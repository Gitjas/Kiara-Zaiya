Leaving her parents home, she became servant to a powerful elemental mage, specializing in poisons. She spent most of her youth with him and was soon attracted to a new form of magic: wild magic. She started secretly studying it from the mage's book collection, although he prohibited such learning. During one of her reading, she contracted her affliction and despite numerous attempts never truly found a cure. She will no say more.~
