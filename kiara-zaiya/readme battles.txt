DO NOT PLAY THEM IF NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE TACTICS MOD AND THE LIKE. 


SULDALLANESSAR'S DEMON IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE CORRECT TACTICS AND CAN BE FRUSTRATING AS EVEN THEN HE MIGHT STILL KILL YOU!

JAO DOES NOT TAKE DAMAGE. NO! IT'S NOT A BUG. ON PURPOSE AND IS FRUSTRATING TOO.

JON IRENICUS SUMMONS A LOT (WELL THINK IT'S PART OF HIS NEWLY ACQUIRED BHAALSPAWN POWERS...I NEVER LIKED THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE SLAYER. IT'S TOO EASY FOR A 20TH LEVEL PARTY.). HE IS VERY TOUGH BUT EASIER THAN THE DEMON

HAVE FUN!
