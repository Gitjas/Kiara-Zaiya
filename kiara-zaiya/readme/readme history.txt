Kiara-Zaiya V1.6.1 Fr-Es-Ge-Ru

This version of Kiara-Zaiya is based on v1.6 available on Final Exodus (http://www.final-exodus.net/resting/index.php?s=6935f14625f988c38e2f694fd8c82579&showforum=13).
The main change is the inclusions of French, Spanish and German translations.
In the process, several previously untraified dialogues or other items were traified to allow the translations to cover everything in the mod.


Changes from the official v1.6 (up to v1.6.1 FrEsGeRu):
- translation to French, Spanish, German and Russian
- dialogs and TP2 files traified for hardcoded English strings
- several warnings during installation were fixed
- text conflicts between the two main tra files were fixed (causing Kiara leaving dialog to use several component names instead of the proper line)
- typo causing the absence of a dialog line fixed
- Myself and !Dead(Myself) corrections in Sulda/KZ#Qilkw.BAF,KZNINJA.BAF and WU-JE/KZJAO.BAF (http://www.shsforums.net/topic/42220-fixes-for-the-big-fixpack/page__view__findpost__p__483485)
- replacements for Sulda/KZ#DMLRD.BAF (http://www.shsforums.net/topic/42220-fixes-for-the-big-fixpack/page__view__findpost__p__483525)
- added VERSION-flag
- changed to README command
- moved Setup-Kiara-Zaiya.tp2 into the mod folder
- update to WeiDU v215

Changes from v1.6.1 FrEsGeRu:
- use a normal version identification ;-)
- update to WeiDU v224
- converted all bcs to baf, allowing the direct use of text references in the scripts and facilitating maintenance
- reworked tp2 to compile them instead of copying the bcs
- exploit the music variable in Kiara.baf directly (using EVALUATE_BUFFER when compiling)
- fix for the romance music in ToB (couldn't be played as the song number was not properly set)
- duplication of soundset fix patch scripts, for normal or custom soundsets
- inclusion of soundset in the CRE file (dialog fix not required now, although still available)
- included Hoppy's suggested fixes for the Amaralis group in Small Teeth Pass (Morticia, ...)
  (http://www.shsforums.net/topic/46469-bwp-and-mod-bugs-not-yet-fixed/page__view__findpost__p__501418)
- replaced Dead("Myself") and Dead("Player1") with StateCheck(...,STATE_REALLY_DEAD) in many scripts
  (generalisation of Lollorian's work)
- many warning fixes in scripts, hopefully improving Kiara's fighting skills as well as opponents' and
  also a few cutscenes



Thanks

- Saemon for the Spanish translation
- Leonardo Watson for the German translation
- Gingerrr and Prowler for the Russian translation
- Elgaern, Bloody.Mary and Lothringen of les d'Oghmatiques for the French translation
- Graoumf for bug reports
- AlanMC and Seifer for the mod

Hopefully, these changes will find their way in the official version.
