<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">!!!IMPORTANT NOTICE!!!<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="Sect0"></a><br>
  1. This download does not include the custom soundset for Kiara and Zaiya!!! 
  You can download it separately from the Kiara-Zaiya website.<br>
  2. To find Zaiya (Slum's district) and then Kiara (follow the quests set to 
  you), your character needs to be of either good or neutral alignment. You can't 
  start evil!! Don't cheat, bugs will lurk around if you do!<br>
  3. Kiara or Zaiya leave for good if one or the other is killed *permanently* 
  (out of party - this is not a bug). Though, they won't leave if one is showing 
  dead in the party slot.<br>
  4. Kiara and Zaiya leave the party for *good* in Brynnlaw if you have not done 
  enough quests around Athklata (this is not a bug). The reason is: it serves 
  the general story.<br>
  5. Watcher's keep is hidden in SOA (this is not a bug)<br>
  6. Conflict with Valen: not all Valen dialogs will appear (unresolved issue).<br>
  On a general note the MOD is untested with other MODs but should work with most 
  of them, like tactics (tested a few battles), Kelsey (was reported working by 
  Seif), Tashia, Oversight MOD...I also added some lines for Solaufein.<br>
  7. Some of you may want to cheat: changing equipment, adding a bit of XP...may 
  be fine. Once you reach the fundamentals of this new MOD (alignment and variables), 
  you will find bugs beyond my control...Another cheat example: you can try to 
  have only Zaiya or Kiara in the game though there are so many variables they 
  exchange (including Kiara's AI script) you'll find bugs everywhere! DO NOT TRY 
  and then tell me you found a bug!!!<br>
  8. Kiara ships with two different portraits. To have the more oriental one, 
  check in Kiara-Zaiya\Portraits folder the readme file provided. </font></p>

  !!!ADULT CONTENT WARNING!!!<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This MOD contains some love scenes 
  between the main character and Kiara. It also contains some *sex jokes*. I would 
  categorize none of these as adult material though it may hurt the sensibility 
  of some of you. If you object to it, DO NOT PLAY THE MOD.</font></p>

  Installation<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
  TOB is now a requirement for this mod</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Unzip the main ZIP file into your 
  BGII main directory. This is normally:<br>
  X :\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA where X is the letter of the drive you 
  have installed K&amp;Z.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Run (click on) &quot;Setup-Kiara.exe&quot;. 
  <br>
  You may always uninstall later by re-running &quot;Setup-Kiara.exe&quot;. </font></p>

  Kiara-Zaiya<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Zaiya <br>
  ~~~~~<br>
  Zaiya is offered to you as a joinable NPC if you are a GOOD OR NEUTRAL ALIGNED 
  CHARACTER ONLY (CHAOTIC_GOOD,NEUTRAL_GOOD, LAWFUL_GOOD, CHAOTIC_NEUTRAL, TRUE_NEUTRAL, 
  LAWFUL_NEUTRAL). This is essential to the game!!! Zaiya can be found inside 
  the slaver ship (slums district).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> QUEST<br>
  ~~~~~<br>
  She has a specific quest right from the start (find her friend Kiara). She DIES 
  PERMANENTLY if you can't find Kiara in the allocated time (she will tell you 
  more once you find her). Advice: save often until quest resolved! The battles 
  will be hard if you are at a low level (below 300,000 XP point per party member) 
  but that's the fun about it! Other possibility you come back and pick up Zaiya 
  at a highler level, which means you'll miss on good scenes that have been planted 
  throughout the game or YOU can't find her anymore!.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> KIARA<br>
  ~~~~~<br>
  Kiara is offered to you as a joinable NPC after you resolve some specific quests 
  AND YOU STILL HAVE ZAIYA IN YOUR PARTY - ALIVE -.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">SPECIAL ABILITIES FOR KIARA:<br>
  Level 6: Shadow Stance (improved invisibility for a full turn...Bhaltazar's 
  original spell)<br>
  Level 10: Snake Stance (improved haste modified for Kiara: attacks are doubled 
  minus one upto a maximum of 7 attacks per round at level 18+). This ability 
  lasts 6 rounds and can be combined with stunning blow, quivering palm or any 
  other special abilities she may have. Kiara gets penalties for using this spell.<br>
  Level 16: Snake stance (Second and last)<br>
  Level 19: Solar Stance (fireball explodes away from her body and blows away 
  enemies. A Balthazar spell modified.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">OTHER SPECIAL ABILITIES ON OCCASION:<br>
  Dragon Stance: with this spell Kiara aquires for a short time some of the dragon's 
  innate strength and resistances. Critical strike in the first round, her strength 
  is set at 25 for 3 rounds, 25% resistance to slashing, crushing, piercing... 
  protection from wing buffet (can not be blown back for a considerable distance) 
  and unconsciousness for a full turn. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">SPECIAL ITEM<br>
  She comes with a special monk robe that adds 10% magic resistance (+1 AC Bonus/+1 
  to all saving throws) and the guardian's ring (+2 AC Bonus/+2 to all saving 
  throws). <br>
  An improved monk robe (+2 AC/+2 saving throws/Immune to level drain and Regenerate 
  1HP every 6 seconds/True sight once day) *may* be added in one particular circumstances. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">SPECIAL BONUSES:<br>
  Strength and Hit points and experience points...*may* be added in one particular 
  circumstance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TALK TO KIARA TO ENABLE BATTLE SCRIPT/FLIRTING/FIXING 
  SCRIPT</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. Enable: &quot;Kiara, time to 
  show us your fighting skills.&quot;<br>
  2. Fix battle by resetting the timer: &quot;What's wrong with your fighting 
  skills, Kiara?&quot; <br>
  3. Disable (set as default): &quot;Kiara, let me direct you in the incoming 
  battles.&quot; <br>
  4. Start Flirting: Flirt with Kiara (only from love talk 2 to love talk 36).<br>
  5. Run fixing script (if you installed another MOD after Kiara, then reinstalled 
  Kiara): Never Mind.</font></p>

  <a name="Sect4"></a>Section IV. HLA for Monks<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
  This HLA was prepared by T.G. Maestro:<br>
  The HLA is the High Level Abilities. This one replaces the Monk's selection 
  of spells from the fighter pool abilities to a complete different set. You can 
  read it from Kiara's spell folder &quot;description.txt&quot;. I would definitely 
  try it as Kiara will have far more interesting spells like dragon fist, capable 
  of removing a mage's protections (yes everything from spell trap to protection 
  from magic weapons!)<br>
  Well if you tested Kish's excellent Monk HLA, you may want to leave it. This 
  one is perhaps more balanced (Eg: no lunar stance) and fewer Balthazar spells 
  but others instead (Chant, Evasion and Greater evasion which are rogue HLA).</font></p>

  Tougher golem room<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It changes the cheat whereby in 
  De Arnise, you could take on the Golems one by one. Beware! Six angry golems 
  rushing at you will be quite a surprise.</font></p>

  <a name="Sect6"></a>Section VI. Original improved Amaralis<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When this option is installed, first 
  you will find a less cheesy opponent in chapter 2. He will still use low spells 
  BUT a few more well chosen ones and will use &quot;improved haste&quot; instead 
  of just &quot;haste&quot;. But then don't forget he is master slaver of Akhlata, 
  something of the kind was to be expected! In chapter 6, you will find four more 
  deadly opponents in Amaralis's party (A mage, a druid, a second beserker yielding 
  soul reaver and a elven ranger with a long bow and poison arrows). You are ill 
  advised to try this fight unless you are familiar with tactics and the likes! 
  The standard Amaralis Chapter 6 fight is hard enough. <br>
  This option was developed in the spirit of ascension and tactics.</font></p>

  BATTLE SCRIPT<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I - What does the script actually 
  do?<br>
  II - How do I best use the script?<br>
  III - Brief overview of the scripts tactics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NB: You may replace the word spell 
  with the word innate ability, all in all they are the same.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I - What does the script actually 
  do?<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="BS1"></a>BATTLE SCRIPT: 
  Kiara can, at high level, clear out an entire area without your assistance with 
  the script ON. She is quite slow at the start of the game but becomes a dervish 
  of destruction by level 18!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Risk assessement instructions have 
  been included that prevent Kiara using all of her spells against low level enemies 
  (gibberlings, kobolds, Ankheg...), she will only activate stunning blow against 
  such foes! Don't expect her to use solar stance on gibberlings.<br>
  For all other enemies, the script works on a timer and will activate every round 
  a new spell (IF she has the spell memorized AND the condition for its release 
  is met!):</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The battle is automatically disabled 
  if Kiara detects a high level mage alone (example Lich) protected from magic 
  weapons (improved mantle, protection from magical, absolute immunity...), she 
  does not see or detect any other enemy and she does not have dragon fist. Kiara 
  was uselessly wasting her spells on various lich found in the game. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">WARNING 1: The script (IF ACTIVATED) 
  messes up in several occasions:<br>
  1. You cast a spell (eg: hardiness) just prior engaging a battle/seeing an enemy. 
  The timer will be messed up! She will stay idle since the timer expired but 
  she can't cast her ability yet! Once she casts the spell, the timer is still 
  ahead and she again waits, despite the fact that the timer is set after &quot;cast 
  the spell&quot; instruction!<br>
  2. You have her use a potion or make her cast a spell during a battle! This 
  will also mess up the timer, resulting in the same problem.<br>
  3. She messes up by herself in some *rare* occasions. One example: she just 
  casted a spell, last enemy dead (combat is over) but then suddenly an enemy 
  spawns, the timer gets messed up! </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">SOLUTION: Talk to her and ask her: 
  &quot;What's wrong with your fighting skills, Kiara?&quot; This will reset the 
  timer and everything should be fine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">WARNING 2: The battle script, *even 
  if disabled*, will still activate some abilities or spells from time to time:<br>
  1. If Kiara sees a high level mage (Eg: Lich, Irenicus...) and her magic resistance 
  is below 75%: Shadow Stance! Enemy can not target invisible creatures.<br>
  2. If she has very few hit points left, she will use monk heal or a potion then 
  re-engage battle. After that, if she has still or again few hit points left, 
  she will cast shadow stance and leave the combat area until half hit points 
  restored, using potions to speed up recovery. When almost half hit points restored, 
  she will return to the battlefield and if any enemy left, activate her battle 
  script whether ON initially or not...<br>
  3. Enemy is invisible/hiding: cast true seeing if she acquired the second robe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="#Sect0">Back to top</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  <a name="BS2"></a> II - How do I best use the script?<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. The battle script is better reserved 
  for hard battles since she will use all of her most powerful spells first in 
  a very short time. On some very long battles in TOB, Sendai and Melissan, it 
  will be useless.<br>
  2. On a general note, DO NOT INTERFERE with the script, except directing her 
  to a specific foe to attack or forcing an attack.<br>
  a. If you want somebody in particular to be attacked first (eg: Drizzt), first 
  move Kiara close to the enemy to attack, then attack. If no orders are given 
  or she sees a closer enemy than the one directed, she will attack her nearest 
  enemy.<br>
  b. DO NOT force any abilities or make her use potions if you have the battle 
  script on! This will disrupt the timer and she may stand idle for a while, refusing 
  orders to attack. If you did, see above Warning 1. This is the only recovery 
  possible. The timers are re-set when the battle is over or she is self healing 
  but it will not be reset during a fight.<br>
  c. Sometimes, she may seem to stand idle (one or two second max), *do not interfere 
  except to force an attack on an enemy*, an ability will be cast soon and she 
  will resume her attacks.<br>
  d. For those who are on difficulty Insane, she casts Hardiness as contingency 
  as from level 20 if you have the spell memorized (you need to select the spell 
  only once from the special abilities).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="#Sect0">Back to top</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  <a name="BS3"></a>III - Brief overview of the scripts tactics.<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It's based on simple principles: 
  first disable your enemies if they are in a group (War cry, Solar tance), if 
  your enemy has protections then disable his protections (dragon fist), then 
  check your health and use lay on hands or potions if below 50%, then use the 
  most powerful abilites to kill your enemies. Last and if severely taxed, go 
  and hide using either shadow stance or a potion of invisibility, then wait using 
  potions to heal before returning to the main character and engage combat again 
  if enemies are around!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. Preparation spells (First one 
  spell goes off from the following list):</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">* Solar Stance: if see group of 
  enemy and they are in range of Solar Stance<br>
  * War Cry: if group of enemy in range with level lower than 9<br>
  * Dragon fist (HLA): if her nearest enemy has protections (magic_weapons, stoneskins, 
  spell turning...)<br>
  * Shadowless kick: victim rendered unconscious - no save against this spell! 
  <br>
  * Snake Stance: doubles attacks per round minus one for 6 rounds (1 turn)<br>
  * Solar Stance: if see group of enemy and they are in range of Solar stance<br>
  * Greater DeathBlow: enemy level = or lower than 12<br>
  * DeathBlow: enemy level = or lower than 8<br>
  * Quivering palm: if enemy save vs spell is = or above 8. <br>
  * Dragon Stance: sets strength at 25 for three round, critical strike in the 
  first round, 25% resistance to slashing,...<br>
  * Smite or (tiger strike): critical strike in the first round, with enemy rendered 
  unconscious and blown back if save failed.<br>
  * Critical Strike: all hits are criticals hits.<br>
  * Quivering Palm: if enemy save vs spell is lower than 8.<br>
  * Stunning blow: enemy stunned if failed his saving throw<br>
  * Power attack: same as stunning blow</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  B. After the preparation spells, conditional spells are first activated if the 
  condition is met every round (6 seconds real time):</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">* Chant: if HP less than 66% (60% 
  resistance to slashing, piercing, crushing...for 3 rounds)<br>
  * Lay on hands: hitpoints less than 50% and amounts of lay hands is over 27<br>
  * Use a healing potion: hitpoints less than 50%; does not have lay on hands<br>
  * Lay on hands: hitpoints less than 50% and amounts of lay hands is below 27<br>
  * Solar Stance!: if see a group of enemy with level superior or equal to 9<br>
  * War Cry: group of enemy level = or lower than 9<br>
  * Dragon fist: if her nearest enemy has protections (magic_weapons, stoneskins, 
  spell turning...)<br>
  * Greater DeathBlow: enemy level = or lower than 12<br>
  * DeathBlow: enemy level = or lower than 8</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  Then all other spells activate every round (6 seconds real time):</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">* Shadowless kick:<br>
  * Snake Stance:<br>
  * Quivering palm: if enemy save vs spell is above 5. <br>
  * Dragon Stance:<br>
  * Quivering Palm: if enemy save vs spell is below 5.<br>
  * Smite (1 round later)<br>
  * Critical Strike (1 round later)<br>
  * Stunning blow (2 round later until exhausted) <br>
  * Power attack (2 round later until exhausted)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If has all spells (condition met) 
  she will cast all the spells, or skip to the next available spell. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE SCRIPT COULD STILL BE IMPROVED 
  DRASTICALLY BY DIFFERENTIATING THE TYPE OF CREATURES OR GROUP OF CREATURES FACED 
  ESPECIALLY AT HIGH LEVEL BUT I DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO DO SO.</font></p>

  Known Bugs <br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The MOD was tested and you should 
  *hopefully* be able to finish the game hassle free. But occasionally conflicts 
  and bugs arise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you wished to report a bug, please 
  do so if you have been playing a clean game (no cheats!). There are so many 
  cross variables in Kiara-Zaiya that using CLUAConsole or ShadowKeeper and cheat 
  will result in a bug! That includes changing fundamental variables for your 
  characters like alignment and such.</font></p>

  <a name="Sect10"></a>X. Credit section<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The MOD's romance and plot improvement: 
  Seif and Jesara. <br>
  I can't stress how important their help has been in improving both the romance 
  but also the general plot.<br>
  It led to the complete rewriting of 10 love talks, revisiting the entire romance 
  (including some partial rewriting and merging) and the creation of 8 new dialogs 
  with the PC whether in romance or not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Editing, proofreading, ideas, website 
  construction, portrait editing (including sending his own for Amaralis), voicing 
  (well Amaralis again), testing,..: <br>
  I can't thank you enough for helping me out on this MOD. What can I say? </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  Seif: you're the man!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">New dialogs: I'd like to thank Bri 
  (Brianna) for her invaluable contribution towards this MOD, mainly the new erotic 
  stories and the Cernd-Zaiya short romance</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Editing: Jessayla has done a marvelous 
  job at the edit. It is unfortunate I did not give her this readme...:)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Portrait of Kiara by Amalthea: <br>
  The sketch is truly great work and I can't wait for final portrait.<br>
  The other portraits provided are mine and *please* should not be used with another 
  MOD, they are Kiara-Zaiya.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Soundset:<br>
  A special thank to Sorschana: her voice and acting are just awesome. I can't 
  think of anything else that integrates so well in BGII. Well, she sure has a 
  BIG fan of her work!<br>
  Thanks to Domi: her accent is going to bring an exotic touch to Zaiya. Besides, 
  her acting is very good too!<br>
  <br>
  Beta tesing:<br>
  Amongst testers, I'd like to thank particularly Castamir (Mike) for his trial 
  of the MOD which hopefully led to the killing of all undesired bugs in the game. 
  I'm being hopeful here, it would be faster with a spray! :-)<br>
  I'm still waiting for Jesara, TGM and Seif's comments but given the schedule 
  set for the release it was impossible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">HLA and Kiara balancing: <br>
  My thanks to T.G. Maestro for his valuable insight in reducing Kiara's strength 
  from initially Balthazar to &quot;Hey! Why did she die for? :) Joking aside, 
  he has contributed to make the game more fun. Besides, Kiara will also use most 
  of his own spells and his own HLA table when Kiara reaches level 20. You won't 
  see much before TOB but it will give you an idea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Detectablespells: I would like to 
  thank Cirerrek for letting me use this very good MOD in Kiara-Zaiya and of course 
  it's original developers Kensai Ryu and Vulgar Zildrah. It has been extremely 
  helpful in improving the battles in Kiara-Zaiya.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Translation: <br>
  Thot started the French translation lazy as I am. ;) Thanks Thot!<br>
  Chlo&eacute; has agreed doing the german translation. My German is a bit too 
  rusty for such large endeavour in German. So, thanks Chlo&eacute;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jason Campton: first for letting 
  me use part of his code. I did not give him much choice I must say. :) and secondly 
  for is pertinent advice regarding my old coding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Wes Weimer and WeiDU:<br>
  I long wondered if I should curse the man or kiss his feet? :P I guess a bit 
  of both. :LOL:<br>
  I'll explain: I guess the &quot;parse error...&quot; *is* every modder's nightmare 
  and I got my fair share of it, that said I can't think of a better program to 
  bring the MODs out to you once you get the hang of it!<br>
  I wouldn't have even started modding without it. So, a BIG thank to Wes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Story additional research:<br>
  Thanks to Mikka, I closely avoided the mention AU (Alternate Universe) and her 
  help was useful in making a credible story within Toril. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Kiara-Zaiya forum: <br>
  Neil for first opening the forum. I never quite found the time to thank the 
  webmaster! Thanks Neil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Other help: I would like to thank 
  everybody who left a message on the Kiara-Zaiya forum at FWS and their valuable 
  support and/or help towards this MOD.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Last but not least, Bioware and

  <a name="Sect11"></a>Section XI. FAQ (Spoilers)<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
  Q: What kind of new fights were added to SOA?<br>
  A: <br>
  1. Poisonous Wyvern: two scrolls of protection from poison are supplied, use 
  them. :) They might not be enough though ;) and you might want a cleric to cast 
  dispel invisibility (3rd level spell) and Zaiya cast breach.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. Amaralis first fight (Chapter 
  2): Amaralis is a Male Kensai/Mage (Level 9/13). <br>
  This one has been reduced so any party can easily do it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. Amaralis (and his goons) second 
  fight (chapter 6): <br>
  - Amaralis is still a Male Kensai/Mage (Level increased to 13/15) <br>
  - Hroth'Kar: Male Half Orc Barbarian (level 20)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  NB: To reduce the number of opponents set the game's difficulty level to EASIEST 
  and the barbarian will not appear.<br>
  Beware that the fight is very difficult and leaving the area or trying to hide 
  won't work! There are several tatics that will work on him.<br>
  Do not install the improved Amaralis fight unless you are familiar with tactics. 
  You will find it impossible! They all have higher levels than you and use it 
  quite well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  Q: How many quests do I need to do before leaving for Brynnlaw?<br>
  A: You need two: do first De Arnise and then do either Firkraag, Planar sphere 
  or the ransom quest from the graveyard district.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q: How do I defeat Amaralis the 
  first time?<br>
  A: Use potions, buy a rod of resurrection and use it to resurrect some of your 
  dead fighters. Alternatively, use a monster summoning spell or wand to create 
  additional allies and lure Amaralis away from your fighters. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q: Kiara has been abducted by Bodhi 
  and turned into a vampire. How do I get her back?<br>
  A: Like any other romance character (Anomen, Aerie, Viconia, Jaheira) in BGII 
  abducted by Bodhi.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q: What happened to Amaralis? Where 
  is the long promised second fight?<br>
  A: Check the small teeth pass area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q: The second fight with Amaralis 
  is hard, how do I defeat him and his goons?<br>
  A: By selecting EASY, you get to fight Amaralis only. Don't expect to arrive 
  and win on the first run!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q: Is it possible to get a good 
  Kiara in the end?<br>
  A: Yes. Though, she will be extremely hard to get. Only those who search Amn 
  thoroughly, keep the romance going on *may* get a good Kiara and are lucky...may 
  get a good Kiara.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you want to use the more oriental

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">None of the portraits in this MOD
