@1    = ~From a lost child in Maztica afflicted and cursed, hesitant and shy, blundering her spells most of the time, Zaiya has grown into a powerful mage arraying her spells against <PRO_HESHE>'s ennemies with skillful determination. Beware adventurer, her blunders are no longer in your favor and you may well see a demon close at her side.~
@2    = ~I wished my curse was not mentioned in this book of yours Volo.~
@3    = ~I strongly disapprove. Tragedy often leads to greatness and legend. Failing to mention your affliction would only diminish your true character.~
