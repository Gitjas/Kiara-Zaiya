@71   = ~When asked about her past, Kiara tells you that she was born in the Kara Turian land of Koryo, far east of Faerûn. After the tragic death of her parents, she was rescued by a local monastery and although extremely rare for a girl, raised as a monk. She spent most of her youth there and learnt some basic fighting skills, herbal preparations and meditation. For an obscure reason, although from the tear in her eye you guess a tragic event, she was expelled from the monastery at an early age. She traveled to the west and met some merchants along the road which she escorted first to Tu Lung before embarking aboard a ship to the city of Medina al Afyal. This is an adventure she highly speaks of with an enthusiastic tone in her voice. On arrival at Afyal, she mentions she met Zaiya before being abducted by corsairs and sold as slaves in Athkatla. You see her face darken under her monk's hood; you know she will say no more.~

High level Monks have the ability to focus Ki energies in their bodies in many ways. When using this ability all attacks made by the Monk in the next round will remove the targets Specific Protection (save vs. spell at -2) and one Magical Protection up to 8. level (no save). The victim must save vs. breath to avoid losing all Physical Protections. Creatures hit by Dragon Fist must also save vs. death at -4, or their Magic Resistance will be reduced by 19% for 6 rounds. This effect is cumulative. Dragon Fist always removes the strongest Protection spell from the target.~
@263  = ~Shadowless Kick!~
@264  = ~Shadowless Kick

This ability gives the Monk a one-time attack. This overwhelming assault is always successful, there is no need for a saving throw. The target suffers 5D8 crushing damage and falls unconscious for 1 round (no save). If the opponent fails its saving throw vs. breath at -4, the power of the kick will knock him back for a considerable distance.~
@265  = ~Tiger strike!~
@266  = ~Tiger strike!

With the Tiger strike ability, the monk gains the ability to strike a mighty blow, knocking an opponent back for a considerable distance and stunning the opponent for 1 round. All attacks made in the first round are critical hits. The ability lasts for 2 rounds.

It increases Slashing, Piercing, Crushing and Missile resistances to 60%, increases Fire, Cold, Lightning resistances by 20% and gives 10% Magic Damage resistance. The effects of this ability last for 2 rounds.~
