@2    = ~You do not appear to have Throne of Bhaal installed.~
@3    = ~Kiara~
@4    = ~When asked about her past, Kiara tells you that she was born in the Kara Turian land of Koryo, far east of Faerûn. After the tragic death of her parents, she was rescued by a local monastery and although extremely rare for a girl, raised as a monk. She spent most of her youth there and learnt some basic fighting skills, herbal preparations and meditation. For an obscure reason, although from the tear in her eye you guess a tragic event, she was expelled from the monastery at an early age. She traveled to the west and met some merchants along the road which she escorted first to Tu Lung before embarking aboard a ship to the city of Medina al Afyal. This is an adventure she highly speaks of with an enthusiastic tone in her voice. On arrival at Afyal, she mentions she met Zaiya before being abducted by corsairs and sold as slaves in Athkatla. You see her face darken under her monk's hood; you know she will say no more.~

Achieving absolute control over their bodies, experienced Monks can use this ability to turn into an ethereal state where they become completely invisible and blurred to their enemies. If the Monk makes an attack, or breaks the invisibility by any other means, he/she will become partially visible. Until the ability expires, the Monk gains 6 points bonus to AC, and another 4 points bonus to his AC vs. Missile weapons. The ability lasts 5 rounds.~

@17   = ~Kiara's body~
@18   = ~Kiara was abducted by Bodhi and infected with vampirism, forcing you to slay her. There may be some way to revive though you don't know how what it would be.~
@19   = ~Jerlia's soul~
@20   = ~This is the heart the demon kept, which prevented Jerlia's spirit to be free.~
@21   = ~Ioun Stone~
@22   = ~Yellow Ioun Stone~
@23   = ~This is a small stone that floats in orbit around the owner's head. Simply equip the stone set it in its orbit. These obviously magical stones have different properties depending on their color.~
@24   = ~Highly sought, this Ioun Stone renders it's wearer immune to everything magical or otherwise, that affects mobility in any way. This includes haste and slow spells.

You can also clearly see the shape an eye on one side of the stone and the inscription AO underneath.~
@25   = ~Trade notes~
@26   = ~Prax kept records of his sales on a scroll and you quickly find the name of Kiara on it. She has apparently been sold to Amaralis and was to be delivered to his home in the government district. The rest of the note only gives detailed amounts of his proceeds.~
@27   = ~Zaiya~
@28   = ~When asked about her past, Zaiya tells you that she born in the vicinity of Medina al Afyal in the land of Zakhara, south east of Faerun. Leaving her parents home, she became servant to a powerful elemental mage, specializing in poisons. She spent most of her youth with him and was soon attracted to a new form of magic: wild magic. She started secretly studying it from the mage's book collection, although he prohibited such learning. During one of her reading, she contracted her affliction and despite numerous attempts never truly found a cure. She will no say more.~
@29   = ~Jerlia's soul:

I met a strange ghost named Jerlia in one of the graveyard crypts. She claims a demon stole her soul and she can not be put at rest until she gets it back. Although, she wasn't quite clear as to where I could find the demon, she said he could be hiding near a temple or in a cave.~
@30   = ~Kill Amaralis:

Despite Kiara's treachery, I accepted the Demon Lord's offer to kill Amaralis. Amaralis, master slaver of Athkatla has currently set camp in the small teeth pass area and I have only ten days to do the bidding of the Demon Lord.~
@31   = ~Kill Prelate Wessalen:

I have accepted the Demon Lord's request to kill prelate Wessalen of the Order of the Radiant Heart in the hope that it would save Kiara from a gruesome fate. The Demon Lord gave me three days to commit this monstrous act.~
@32   = ~Prelate Wessalen Dead:

I killed prelate Wessalen and made myself the enemy of the Order of the Radiant Heart. In the process, I shall from now on be perceived as a force of evil in Faerun. Sparing Kiara's life has proven expensive.~
@33   = ~Find Zaiya's friend:

I met a young girl named Zaiya, who seems to suffer from a strange affliction. She told me that her friend Kiara is the only one able to stabilize her condition. We might be able to find some clues as to Kiara's location by asking a man named Prax, near a circus in Athkatla. She cautioned me about her state and that we have only a few days before she dies.~
@34   = ~Oh no! A wild surge! Something horrible must have happened.~
@35   = ~If the mage is truly over five hundred years old, let us be cautious. He must have had all the time to hone his magic skills to perfection.~

@129  = ~Alternate High level abilities by TG Maestro~
@130  = ~Dragon fist!~

High level Monks have the ability to focus Ki energies in their bodies in many ways. When using this ability all attacks made by the Monk in the next round will remove the targets Specific Protection (save vs. spell at -2) and one Magical Protection up to 8. level (no save). The victim must save vs. breath to avoid losing all Physical Protections. Creatures hit by Dragon Fist must also save vs. death at -4, or their Magic Resistance will be reduced by 19% for 6 rounds. This effect is cumulative. Dragon Fist always removes the strongest Protection spell from the target.~
@132  = ~Shadowless Kick!~
@133  = ~Shadowless Kick
This ability gives the Monk a one-time attack. This overwhelming assault is always successful, there is no need for a saving throw.

@135  = ~Tiger strike!
With the Tiger strike ability, the monk gains the ability to strike a mighty blow, knocking an opponent back for a considerable distance and stunning the opponent for 1 round. All attacks made in the first round are critical hits. The ability lasts for 2 rounds.

It increases Slashing, Piercing, Crushing and Missile resistances to 60%, increases Fire, Cold, Lightning resistances by 20% and gives 10% Magic Damage resistance. The effects of this ability last for 2 rounds~
@138  = ~Faster than the eye!~
@139  = ~Faster then the eye!~
@140  = ~Faster than the eye!

The monk gains the ability to move at an incredible speed.~
@141  = ~Solar Stance!
