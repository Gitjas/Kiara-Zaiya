@400  = ~Thank you for releasing me, but I have to quickly find my friend Zaiya.~
@401  = ~I am so glad you found me but please, I need to find my friend.~
@402  = ~Don't worry about your friend, she led us here. My name is <CHARNAME> and I am pleased we found you.~
@403  = ~I am ever so grateful <CHARNAME>. My name is Kiara. I trust you'll take us both into your party.~
@404  = ~You are most welcome to join us. I am always looking for a strong hand to help.~
@405  = ~No, I helped your friend find you but I need no further companions.~
@406  = ~Well then Zaiya, it looks like we'll have to leave.~
@407  = ~I am most pleased by your decision. So what do we do now, <CHARNAME>?~
@408  = ~Well Kiara, I should tell you I have a goal to rescue a friend of mine, Imoen. She has been captured by the Cowled Wizards.~
@409  = ~Well Kiara, I am hunting a very powerful evil mage named Irenicus. ~
@410  = ~Well Kiara, I have no certain destination for now. Perhaps we shall encounter something soon.~
@411  = ~We shall help you as best as we can, <CHARNAME>.~

@350  = ~You...you have saved me...but...What happened to Zaiya? No! You let her die?!~
@351  = ~You have... you have saved me once again. I am truly in your debt, my love.~
@352  = ~No, I am in *your* debt. You restored my spirit with your beguiling ways long ago.~
@353  = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I had feared for some time that Bodhi's final revenge on me would be to take away Kiara forever, it seems that the information in the lorebook was right... Amaunator's idol has not only restored Kiara to life, but has removed the vampire curse from her, as well.  ~
@354  = ~Your weakness nearly cost us all our lives. I trust this will not happen again.~
@355  = ~As well you should be, but I will not hold that against you. I only wish that you return to me.~
@356  = ~I see. No, rest assured that it will not. So, do we travel as before, or do we go our separate ways?~
@357  = ~Yes, get back in the group and let's go.~
@358  = ~No, I do not need you just yet. ~
@359  = ~I am... most glad to be returning to your company, <CHARNAME>.~
@360  = ~And I am more than happy to have you return. Come, rejoin with me and we will see this quest through to its end, together.~
@361  = ~Yes, well... As much as I regret to say it... I do not need you right now.~
@362  = ~I welcome the invitation. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I...~
@363  = ~I missed your company.~
@364  = ~Well, shall we go then?~
@365  = ~Yes, Kiara. Welcome back.~
@366  = ~No, I do not have need of you in the group right now. I am sorry.~
@367  = ~Come Zaiya, let's go to the docks and find a ship to Maztica.~
@368  = ~I do not often express such feelings, but I must say that... I would not wish to be parted from you again.~
@369  = ~You want us to leave after all we have shared together?~
@370  = ~No, I'm sorry.  Please rejoin the group.~
@371  = ~I'm afraid so, you and Zaiya should go.~
@372  = ~You know I can't leave the poor girl on her own...~
@373  = ~Hello <CHARNAME>, are you looking for a ship too?~
@374  = ~Hello Kiara. Actually, I was wondering if you cared to travel with us once again.~
@375  = ~Hi Kiara. No, I happened to be in the area and just wanted to greet you and see how you are doing.~
@376  = ~There is no ship due for Maztica before a few weeks so I guess we have some time ahead of us. It will be a pleasure to join your quest once more.~
@377  = ~We're doing fine. They said a ship is due soon for Maztica.~
@378  = ~Hello <CHARNAME>, what took you so long? You said it would take a few minutes but it looks like days!~
@379  = ~Sorry for the delay Kiara. Please rejoin the group.~
@380  = ~Hi Kiara, I'm afraid you will have to wait longer than I had anticipated.~
@381  = ~Finally, we get to leave this boring place. Zaiya proved to be poor company with her nose always in her books.~
@382  = ~(sigh) How long are we going to wait here?~
@383  = ~You are pathetic and weak. Be gone, fool.~
@384  = ~The attitude of this party is not what I expected.~
@385  = ~Alright. I guess Zaiya and I will go to the docks and find the next ship for Maztica.~
@386  = ~That's fine. I wish you good luck finding a cure for Zaiya.~
@387  = ~Actually, please wait right here. I won't be too long.~
@388  = ~Hello <CHARNAME>, are we to travel together again?~
@389  = ~Yes, Zaiya. You're welcome too.~
@390  = ~I have to follow Kiara...~

//VAMPKIA.D: KIARA VAMPIRE
@450  = ~Yesss, Mistress. Very well.~

//BKIARA.D: BANTER AND ROMANCE

@494  = ~Could you sing a hymn to my beauty or can I perhaps entice you with a love song, my dear tiefling?~ [MxKiaraB]
@495  = ~As you would have it, my dear tiefling.~
@496  = ~So tell me Anomen, why did you choose the Knight's order when your skills could have taken you further without their righteous interference?~ [MxKiaraB]
@497  = ~I couldn't agree less Anomen.~
@498  = ~Is this dark skin your natural color or did you forget to wash whilst hiding in your cabin, ranger?~ [MxKiaraB]
@499  = ~There is no need to be upset...really...bungled wizard.~
@500  = ~Korgan, I heard that dwarves have impressive family jewels. Surely such truth must be exaggerated?~ [MxKiaraB]
@501  = ~Not now Korgan. Let's catch up with the others.~
@502  = ~Edwin, I heard magic is forbidden in Amn...I assume a it is a difficult place for a wizard.~ [MxKiaraB]
@503  = ~Alas Edwin, had you been polymorphed into a toad, I might have found you much more attractive. Let that tell you about your sexual appeal.~
@504  = ~<CHARNAME>, you know Amaralis will come back for *me*, don't you?~
@505  = ~Who was he anyway?~
@506  = ~Why would he come back? The fool almost got himself killed.~
@507  = ~This is of no consequence. Pressing matters call for our attention. Let's cut the babble.~
@508  = ~You may have found him alone in his house, but he was unprepared for you. Also you *must* be aware that he is the Master Slaver of Athkatla.~
@509  = ~He and his Slaver's Guild do not forget humiliation easily.  Nor do they forgive it.~
@510  = ~You said he would come for *you*, so this is not all about revenge, Kiara, is it?~
@511  = ~I can't simply believe that he would seek revenge alone.~
@512  = ~For reasons unknown to me, Amaralis was led to believe that I hold some valuable information. He probably still believes this to be true.~
@513  = ~And do you hold such information?~
@514  = ~Kiara, tell me about Zaiya's curse?~
@515  = ~Very well, my apologies. I won't bother you again.~
@516  = ~It's a long tale <CHARNAME> and we currently have little time. Zaiya's prolonged suffering has exhausted her. We should proceed to the nearest inn with all haste, so I can properly take care of her. With a good day of rest, she should be fit to travel again.~
@517  = ~I told him about a prophecy in Kara-Tur of which he wanted to know more, but he didn't believe me when I told him I knew of nothing more concerning it. I swear to you now that I do not.~
@518  = ~What prophecy is this Kiara? I am somewhat intrigued.~
@519  = ~<CHARNAME>, I was wondering...~ [KIARAM1]
@520  = ~Yes?~
@521  = ~What's on your mind?~
@522  = ~Such prying into one's privacy is becoming rather trying.~
@523  = ~My apologies, I did not mean to encroach on your privacy.~
@524  = ~How did you become an adventurer?~
@525  = ~I was raised by my foster father Gorion in the library-fortress Candlekeep, near Baldur's Gate in the north. It became unsafe, so Gorion decided that we should leave our once-peaceful haven. However, soon after leaving Candlekeep, we were ambushed and Gorion was murdered.  As a result I was forced to take to the road.~
@526  = ~I'm really not interested in discussing that.~
@527  = ~Such a cruel loss!  Take solace, if it helps, in the fact I am no stranger to the emotions you must have felt. My parents were also murdered... Your past, it seems, resembles my own.~
@528  = ~I will listen intently to your tale, should you feel the need to share some of your burden.~
@529  = ~I'm sure it is. Leave me be.~
@530  = ~I was born in the Kara-Turian land of Koryo, very far to the east of Faerun. My parents were humble peasants, living peacefully until the day...the day they were slaughtered in cold blood.~
@531  = ~What happened to them?~
@532  = ~My condolences.~
@533  = ~Oh, how tragic. But I have no intentions to listen further to such sordid tales.~
@534  = ~The neighboring island of Kozakura often waged war on our land in an attempt to overthrow our ruler, Wanang Sung. In 1352, they gathered a large army and landed on our southern shores, taking us by surprise.~
@535  = ~They had also hired wild tribes from the north, luring them with promises of wealth, and marched on our capital city of Tu Pe, burning and ransacking every farm, village, and city that stood in their path.~
@536  = ~Women were raped and then enslaved for the pleasure of the Warlord and his troops, whilst men and boys were brutally slaughtered. Our farm was one of the first to be...~
@537  = ~That's terrible. I am truly sorry.~
@538  = ~If they were killed it means that they were weak.  In my opinion, they deserved exactly what they received. I've heard enough.~
@539  = ~Yes, it was a terrible tragedy, but let me continue my tale..~
@540  = ~My father had seen the approaching army and told me to hide under the haystack we kept for our livestock.~
@541  = ~The events I witnessed that day are still ablaze in my heart.  The passage of time has done nothing to ease the pain I feel. My father was savagely murdered in front of me and my mother raped right before my eyes. Their screams of pain are still as vivid in my memory as they were that day.~
@542  = ~How did you survive?~
@543  = ~Surely, a terrible trauma for a young child.~
@544  = ~Of course, my apologies. Some other time, perhaps.~
@545  = ~Perhaps another time. (You see a tear glistening in Kiara's eye and do not wish to push it further.)~
@546  = ~Yes, I still sometimes get nightmares...~
@547  = ~I'm sorry <CHARNAME>, memories can bring more pain than swords sometimes. I am ready to continue my tale, should you still be interested.~
@548  = ~Of course, Kiara. Please go on, if you wish.~
@549  = ~Actually, I lost interest a while back.~
@550  = ~The head of the local monastery, or Do Jang, was a very caring man and decided to send trained monks after the marching armies to care for the wounded.~
@551  = ~I was still lying in my hiding place beneath the haystack when I saw a tall hooded figure approaching our ravaged farm from the horizon.~
@552  = ~He was so quiet and calm. He looked at my dead parents and in acceptance at his lack of powers, prepared to leave. That was when he spotted me under the straw. He took me to the local monastery of Won Kwang.~
@553  = ~So that was how you became a monk...~
@554  = ~You must be grateful for their kindness.~
@555  = ~I must thank fate to have such a beautiful companion at my side.~
@556  = ~Well another fate would have spared us this idle chatter and the trouble your presence seems to stir in our other male companions.~
@557  = ~Do Jang? Won Kwang? Sorry, but you have me lost here~
@558  = ~I'm hardly surprised. Such harsh words are merely the expression of a simple truth, you lack a heart <CHARNAME>.~
@559  = ~Don't flatter me <CHARNAME>, I could get addicted to it. So, where was I...~
@560  = ~Whilst we call a monastery a Do Jang, Won Kwang was the founder of this monastery, which is considered to be one of the ten most respected schools teaching the ways of war and honorable martial arts.~
@561  = ~So, you became a monk...~
@562  = ~Yes, the monks took really good care of me. I was the only girl at the monastery at that time. I guess they felt sorry for me and tolerated my presence.~
@563  = ~As I grew older, I took part in the monks' training and they taught me the basics of martial arts and herbal preparations. They raised me as they would have a boy, but at least I found a much needed peace in meditation, something I had lacked since that heart-rending day my parents were killed..~
@564  = ~I am surprised the monastery only accepted boys, how is that?~
@565  = ~I can assure you that you look like a boy no longer.~
@566  = ~That must have been such a boring life for a young girl.~
@567  = ~Life was extremely harsh and austere at the monastery. Even so, it provided an opportunity for the poor to give their first born males a chance to be raised above their stations.~
@568  = ~The monastery enforced a rule accepting males only. I was the sole exception.~
@569  = ~Well, more events took place later on in my life but such anecdotes are not to be told.~
@570  = ~I am surprised the monastery hosted only males, how is that?~
@571  = ~Life at the monastery must have been rather boring.~
@572  = ~Would you go back to the monastery if you could?~
@573  = ~Well, meditation and learning martial arts were the essential part of daily life during most of my youth. We didn't have much entertainment, so yes, it was extremely dull, until I met Osan...~
@574  = ~I am surprised the monastery hosted males only, how is that?~
@575  = ~Would you go back to a life of peace and meditation if you could?~
@576  = ~Who is Osan?~
@577  = ~This is intriguing. Tell me more about a typical day at your monastery?~
@578  = ~No. I've found that there is so much fun out there that I missed during my youth, and so many other things that were denied to me. Never. I could never go back to that.~
@579  = ~Who is this Osan you mentioned?~
@580  = ~Osan...was also a monk at the monastery, but.. Let's get going. I feel a cold chill in the air.~
@581  = ~The daily routine was set by Master Won Kwang and has seen no change since it was first established some 432 years ago. We rose before dawn and started two hours of exercise, then spent time in meditation before a frugal breakfast of rice porridge.~
@582  = ~Studies then occupied the remainder of our mornings, except on holy days when we worshiped in the temples. An hour break was allowed before our midday snack, and the afternoon was spent practicing martial arts under the watchful eyes of the school masters.~
@583  = ~At sunset we began to worship with the chants of Ki Rho Zsa, and we burned incense by the idols in the shrine that Wong Kwang built.~
@584  = ~The evening meal preceded a session where the master taught the power of focus to enhance our Ki before heading to our sleeping mattress.~
@585  = ~This has been my daily life for more than a decade and I got used to it. You would not doubt consider it the pinnacle of boredom.~
@586  = ~Would you go back to such a life if you could?~
@587  = ~Umm! Yes, Candlekeep was harsh and strict at times, but at least we found more time for ourselves. So who is this Osan you mentioned earlier?~
@588  = ~You wanted to hear about Osan?~
@589  = ~Yes, it's an intriguing name.~
@590  = ~From the tone of your voice, I sense he was dear to your heart...~
@591  = ~I can hardly keep up with all the chatter going on in this party. So, no thanks.~
@592  = ~I must have been sixteen years of age when I met Osan. Like myself, he was a young monk.~
@593  = ~I wouldn't have noticed him in a monastery that counted almost a thousand members if we hadn't once collided into one another. We literally fell on top of each other.~
@594  = ~At the monastery, I wore my hair short and a robe shrouded my face the shadows. Few monks ever noticed I had become a woman instead of the scrawny girl they'd taken in years ago...~
@595  = ~I find it hard to believe that your looks went unnoticed.~
@596  = ~Osan discovered your womanhood, then?~
@597  = ~Did your monastery cater for the blind? I can hardly believe that no one *ever* noticed your beauty before.~
@598  = ~You are right. Let's get going.~
@599  = ~Do you find it so hard to believe when I do this? (Kiara pulls her hood up over her head, shadowing her lovely features.)~
@600  = ~Hum... yes, I can hardly see your face now. Your hood is large enough to hide a troll under, let alone a young woman. So, Osan despite your disguise, discovered your womanhood.~
@601  = ~Much more in fact, Osan acted like a mirror.~
@602  = ~His gaze fell upon me and I saw genuine surprise in his eyes. For the first time of his life, he saw a woman.~
@603  = ~His embarrassment was plain to see and he apologized in a trembling voice, but his eyes were full of yearning and desire. At that precise moment, I discovered I was indeed a woman, not just a monk.~
@604  = ~So you started to have a little fling, did you?~
@605  = ~How can you be so sure he was yearning after an ugly duck such as yourself?~
@606  = ~It was love at first sight for both of us. From then on, we would spend most of our meditation together, alone, under the peaceful shadow of an oak tree.~
@607  = ~Our relation was still platonic at that time, both of us burning with desire, but too shy to make the first move.~
@608  = ~Let me guess, you were the one to kiss him?~
@609  = ~You? Shy?! You have every man shivering with unrestrained lust each time we enter an inn!!~
@610  = ~Kiara, I bear little interest in you relating tales of your first love...~
@611  = ~If I am such an ugly duck, why have you been staring at me for the last two days?~
@612  = ~Anyway, I guess the little *ugly* duck started to have a little fling?~
@613  = ~Such strong words! I was not staring merely watching your fighting skills at times.~
@614  = ~ Your own fantasies surely, but please do continue on your tale...~
@615  = ~I do admit I have been watching you from time to time. I hope you are not offended.~
@616  = ~Such blunt lies! But let me continue my story of Osan.~
@617  = ~Sure.~
@618  = ~Well at that time, I was really was genuinely shy. ~
@619  = ~One day, under the shade of the old oak tree, I gently pulled him to me, his head tilted towards mine. As I gazed into his eyes, a warm feeling embraced me from within.~
@620  = ~I lowered my lips and kissed him. His lips parted, and my tongue caressed his, exploring him for the first time. Wanting to find his secrets, his passions.~
@621  = ~We melted into each others arms, becoming one in our desires.~
@622  = ~I...I don't know what to say. Why do you share such intimate moments of your life with me?~
@623  = ~I don't see the point in this. Don't you have any sense of intimacy?~
@624  = ~I am sorry but my interest falters...Let's stop this conversation here, shall we?~
@625  = ~I will not allow such intimate conversation to take place in my party, Kiara.~
@626  = ~Have you ever kissed someone, <CHARNAME>?~
@627  = ~Well, my sister... On the cheek once...~
@628  = ~Uh,... yes.... but I do not wish to expose any of my intimate moments as you do, Kiara.~
@629  = ~Well, I kissed my sister's friend once...~
@630  = ~If you're just going to answer a question with a question, I'd rather avoid further embarrassment.~
@631  = ~That's hardly what I meant, <CHARNAME>, however I won't embarrass you further...(chuckle) Let's move on.~
@632  = ~I have a sneaking suspicion you haven't...but this would further embarrass you, wouldn't it?~
@633  = ~And did you feel the passion stirring your body or was it a mere childish kiss?~
@634  = ~It was passionate and wild...I often wonder what became of her...~
@635  = ~I was kissing her good-bye when she left Candlekeep...~
@636  = ~Do you want to hear about my first night with Osan?~
@637  = ~If you care to share such intimate moments, why not?~
@638  = ~Do I really have a choice?~
@639  = ~Do you know of any bedtime stories: the three little piggies? I don't really want to know all about your sex life.~
@640  = ~I'm sorry, but I have no wish to further share your intimacy, Kiara.~
@641  = ~One night, we decided we had to push the relationship further. The stolen kisses were delicious, but we needed a main course. One night we decided to take our chances in one of the empty cells reserved for dignitaries visiting our monastery.~
@642  = ~Everything was perfect. Our kisses were feverish, passionate. I felt his hand sliding under my robe...~
@643  = ~So, what happened next?~
@644  = ~Tell me Kiara, what is the point in sharing these intimate moments? Don't you feel you should keep some privacy?~
@645  = ~If this is some attempt to stir my passion, you failed.~
@646  = ~I do not wish to hear your stories, so let's stop it.~
@647  = ~I don't see the point in going into such lengthy details. I've heard enough.~
@648  = ~No, unless you want to hear the one about the three little ugly ducks?~
@649  = ~Not really either, let's hear your story then. (sigh)~
@650  = ~Well, then let's continue our journey, in silence, as monks are supposed to.~
@651  = ~It is a sad ending I'm afraid. The head of the monastery had late guests that night of which we were unaware. As you can imagine, the worst befell us.~
@652  = ~They caught you in the act.~
@653  = ~Most frustrating, I believe.~
@654  = ~The road of adventure brings very few pleasures along its path. I attempt only to make the road more agreeable...~
@655  = ~..and perhaps see if this muscle-hardened body of yours will ever quiver...~
@656  = ~An attempt at which you will hardly succeed...But tell me what happened to you and Osan?~
@657  = ~A goal that reveals an attraction...perhaps more...a desire for a strong man such as myself.~
@658  = ~Possibly...Though you are quick to jump to conclusions. Let me tell you what happened to Osan and I...~
@659  = ~Sure, enjoy the meditation and...the lonely nights.~
@660  = ~Sadly, yes.~
@661  = ~Naked like worms, there was no way we could justify our presence in this cell. The head of our monastery called for the guards and had us dragged out to the main courtyard, still half naked.~
@662  = ~He then ordered all monks to come and witness our punishment. I had never felt so humiliated in my life.~
@663  = ~You had forsaken the trust of those who had cared for you. How could you let this happen with Osan?~
@664  = ~If you ask me, you looked for trouble in the first place.~
@665  = ~I'm sorry your first love experience turned to such a disaster. It should have been the best time of your life...I feel sorry for you.~
@666  = ~A person must bear the consequences of their actions. I'm sure you were aware you were living in a monastery.~
@667  = ~Alright then, let's cut it off.~
@668  = ~If this is how you feel we may as well stop it right here.~
@669  = ~I'm sorry to have interrupted you with my disobliging remarks. Let's hear the rest of your tale.~
@670  = ~There is nothing else to be added then.~
@671  = ~I guess you are right. I'll never forget the bastard. If I only could get my hands on him, I'd tear his head off.~
@672  = ~You mean the head of the monastic order?~
@673  = ~After gathering the assistance of one thousand men, the head of our monastery designated two monks to carry out our punishment, the whip.~
@674  = ~Osan was the first one to receive the lashes. He managed to remain silent during the first few strokes of the whip, taking each upon himself. He didn't want them to feel any satisfaction, but as his skin became bruised and discolored and as his blood wept crimson tears from the brutal lashes, he screamed his guts out begging for mercy.~
@675  = ~After the last stroke of the whip, Osan collapsed on the ground, his head making a loud noise as it slammed against the heavy stone.~
@676  = ~That's horrible! Did they do the same to you?~
@677  = ~The punishment may seem severe but your acts deserved a harsh treatment.~
@678  = ~I believe they did not spare you either.~
@679  = ~Yes, though they stopped at thirty. I still have some scars on my back and the sour taste for revenge in my mouth.~
@680  = ~Go on, what happened to you and Osan?~
@681  = ~And after that?~
@682  = ~Osan died later that night from his wounds. The bastard who'd called himself our Master made him an example for all to see. Osan paid a heavy price for our love.~
@683  = ~I was allowed to recover at the monastery for a few days before being expelled. I felt pain, sadness and anger but my strongest of my feelings was a desire for pure, unrestrained vengeance. I feel, no, I know I will have my revenge someday.~
@684  = ~You should try and put these events behind you. Revenge often leads to more pain and suffering.~
@685  = ~You might have your revenge one day, who knows? Unfortunately, Kara-Tur seems too far for us to travel just yet.~
@686  = ~So much is true, Koryo seems so far now... and the Bhaalspawn would prove too powerful for us anyway.~
@687  = ~A Bhaalspawn! You mean the head of your monastery was a Bhaalspawn?!~
@688  = ~This much is true. I'm afraid we would be no match for the spawn of Bhaal.~
@689  = ~A Bhaalspawn! The head of your monastery was a Bhaalspawn?~
@690  = ~(In a low voice you hear Kiara responding.) Yes, a Bhaalspawn. (Kiara whispers) Balthazar, you owe me. One day you shall pay a heavy price.  Osan's blood shall be joined by your own.  On this I shall swear! (You see this conversation has strained her and that she will speak no more.)~
@691  = ~Tell me <CHARNAME>, I sensed from our previous talk that you have something in common with Bhaal and his offspring. Am I right?~
@692  = ~Well, I guess that people who travel in my party have a right to know. So to answer your question, yes, I am one of Bhaal's children.~
@693  = ~This is not an issue is not to be taken lightly, I do not wish to discuss it with you.~
@694  = ~(Kiara takes an inquisitive look at you, checking you from head to toe. She almost wants to smile but seems to think it is not appropriate.)~
@695  = ~(For a moment she bows her head slightly and you can almost feel her thoughts rushing through her mind. You don't understand her reaction but have the odd feeling that, for the first time, she may be hiding something from you.)~
@696  = ~Are you alright Kiara?~
@697  = ~Stop looking at me like this! Your behavior is an embarrassment to us all.~
@698  = ~What's on your mind Kiara?~
@699  = ~(Kiara stares at you for another few seconds, seeming as if she is about to say something. Her mouth opens but the words seem to be glued to her tongue, and no sound escapes.)~
@700  = ~Please Kiara, say something!~
@701  = ~Yes, I'm fine, <CHARNAME>. Actually, I feel better now. (Kiara smiles.)~
@702  = ~I feel your attitude deserves an explanation Kiara.~
@703  = ~What's this smile for?~
@704  = ~Sorry <CHARNAME>, It's just that...~
@705  = ~Well speak up then, your behavior deserves a full explanation.~
@706  = ~Oh nothing, it's just that your revelation stunned me for a second. The fact that I am actually traveling with a son of the God of Murder is a spine-chilling thought... You had me shivering.~
@707  = ~I find that hard to believe when the head of your monastic order was also a son of Bhaal.~
@708  = ~I am nonetheless a normal <PRO_RACE>, if this is what you where trying to figure out by staring at me.~
@709  = ~In Kara-Tur, we have a prophecy regarding the Bhaalspawn. Do you have such prophecies in your land?~
@710  = ~We do have one: the prophecy of Alaundo.~
@711  = ~I'd like to hear this prophecy from the east.~
@712  = ~What does your prophecy say about them?~
@713  = ~Soon enough, the Bhaalspawn will rain destruction on the land, and afterwards the Lord of Murder will return to reclaim his throne. Pretty gloomy and about as clear as mud if you ask me.~
@714  = ~Well, it's quite blurred and only a few high clerics understand it. I've never been able to understand nor memorize a word of it personally.~
@715  = ~All I know is that it speaks about Bhaalspawn,  about death and about the possible resurrection of the Lord of Murder. But tell me about your prophecy. Is it clearer?~
@716  = ~Not really, it also says that soon enough, the Bhaalspawn will rain destruction upon the land and that afterwards the Lord of Murder will be restored.~
@717  = ~It's quite frightening from either perspective. I think we should continue our journey.~
@718  = ~I was not completely candid the other day, <CHARNAME>. Our prophecy speaks of something else...~
@719  = ~You have me interested.~
@720  = ~I knew you were hiding something. Tell me the true extent of your prophecy.~
@721  = ~Our prophecy also speaks of a woman from our land. She will travel to the west and help one of the Bhaalspawn reveal his tainted blood and true nature.~
@722  = ~It also says that after revealing his true nature, she will become his servant, feeding on his soul and blood to seek the most ferocious of revenge.~
@723  = ~(For a moment, you stare at Kiara, frightened that this prophecy might hold some truth and that under the cover of her innocent stories, a person of great evil lies hidden within.) Do you imply that this woman is... *you*?~
@724  = ~Get away from me, evil bitch! How do you expect me to believe a word of what you say after such covert lies?~
@725  = ~Nobody can alter the path I have taken! I control the evil taint and shall not let some half truth guide my life!~
@726  = ~I...I don't know. When I realized that you were one of them, it became clear to me that our prophecy could be playing itself out right now.~
@727  = ~Whether or not I am this woman our prophecy speaks of, I cannot say, as I have no answers to give you. It could be some other Bhaalspawn traveling with another woman from my land.~
@728  = ~Such a coincidence is highly unlikely, don't you think?.~
@729  = ~Another covert lie Kiara. I have had enough of your mind games and will not let myself manipulated any more!~
@730  = ~I am sorry... I was foolish to bring this up. It appears we should take separate paths to avoid future conflicts. I feel I must leave your party.~
@731  = ~My apologies, I let anger overcome me but it was not really justified.  The taint of Bhaal brings out the worst in those around me so often that anger has become almost commonplace.~
@732  = ~Good riddance, evil bitch.~
@733  = ~Please do not get angry. I was merely relating what our prophecy says. I never said you'd be the one spoken of.~
@734  = ~Ao alone knows how many Bhaalspawn were born. Perhaps hundreds, perhaps thousands.~
@735  = ~Yes, you may be right, but what about the woman in this prophecy? The similarities are striking, and it is as though you were trying to portray us together.~
@736  = ~Yes, you may be right. However, I would find such coincidence striking, don't you think?.~
@737  = ~Only the future may tell us, <CHARNAME>. Let us continue our travels. (You have a vague feeling that you will sleep uneasily in the coming days.)~
@738  = ~Tell me about your sister, <CHARNAME>? This Imoen we are to rescue...I would like to know more about her.~
@739  = ~There isn't much to say really. We grew up together in Candlekeep and were both raised by Gorion. She is not really my sister but I like to think of her this way.~
@740  = ~In all truth, she is only my half sister. My heart fills with joy when I think about her. Besides, she has been such a strong and helpful companion after Gorion's death that it breaks my heart to know she is now in the clutches of the Cowled wizards.  It is for her own sake as well as my own that I seek to rescue her.~
@741  = ~I'd rather not talk of her right now.~
@742  = ~You have some strong feelings about her...perhaps fraught with sexual desires.~
@743  = ~I don't know where your mind is getting such ideas.~
@744  = ~No, you are mistaken. I bear no such thoughts about Imoen and never will.~
@745  = ~I love her deeply as a sister but would not bear such impure thoughts.~
@746  = ~Your reluctance is understandable. Let's move on then.~
@747  = ~If not your sister, then a handsome man such as yourself surely has someone he holds dear in his heart? ~
@748  = ~Circumstances have deprived me of such favorable encounters. Most of my past is filled with blood and chaos, and my future does not look any brighter.  Hardly the most romantic lifestyle with which to attract women.~
@749  = ~No, but even if I had I wouldn't tell you, Kiara.~
@750  = ~I do, but I'm afraid such revelation is far too compromising.~
@751  = ~Oh come on, I've revealed much more distressing secrets to you. Please...I'd so love to know. Tell me...~
@752  = ~Well, she is tall, has brown eyes and a muscular body...~
@753  = ~I can tell you it is certainly not you.~
@754  = ~Stop teasing! That description fits every woman in this party.~
@755  = ~All right then, the truth and beyond...She is not from Faerun.~
@756  = ~Well, it is certainly not you...~
@757  = ~Zaiya?~
@758  = ~She is attractive, but no. She spends far too much time with her books.~
@759  = ~I thought so, but then again you know little of me. (Kiara laughs coyly and gives you a demure look.)~
@760  = ~I wonder if this interest of yours is really sincere or merely fraught with sexual desires.~
@761  = ~I think you should listen to more of my story as maybe your interest will falter. But as it is getting late, we should keep going.~
@762  = ~Perhaps you are to blame, closing your heart when it was time to let it blossom.~
@763  = ~You may be right. I've never given much thought to it. The adventuring life has given me little time to dwell upon such thoughts.~
@764  = ~I couldn't agree less, though you may be looking further than necessary. One is often ignorant of the most obvious.~
@765  = ~What do you mean?.~
@766  = ~You need not to stare at me to know what I mean, <CHARNAME>. But it's getting late. We should continue our travels.~
@767  = ~I wish to tell you what happened after I left the monastery...~
@768  = ~Tell me about it.~
@769  = ~We have more pressing matters to attend to today.~
@770  = ~I was alone on the road and had no idea of what to do nor where to go. I had spent all my life in the shelter of the monastery. I knew nothing of the outside world.~
@771  = ~I wandered aimlessly on the road for a few days. I ate fruits from the trees, grass roots and even insects and rats so that I might survive.~
@772  = ~Finally, I made the old road to the farm, a sort of pilgrimage into my past only to find old ruins embedded with plants and trees. I took time to make a small symbolic grave with lovely flowers for my parents and took the road again.~
@773  = ~Insects and rats, what a thrilling diet!~
@774  = ~What did you expect when returning to your parent's farm?~
@775  = ~Fine, <CHARNAME>. Another time perhaps~
@776  = ~Yes, another day would be best.~
@777  = ~I didn't get accustomed eating such food if that’s what you are implying. Snails have quite some flavor, when cooked with garlic though.~
@778  = ~I find it quite revolting but please move on with your tale.~
@779  = ~I tasted it once too. It's not all that revolting.~
@780  = ~Nothing I guess, but I had nowhere else to go, so I went to a familiar place.~
@781  = ~Hmm,  makes sense.~
@782  = ~Eating rats and insects, this must have been utterly disgusting~
@783  = ~Whilst on the road to the nearest village, I met a group of merchants that had concluded their trade in our capital city of Tu Pe and were traveling back to their Zakharian homeland in the south, an island called Afyal.~
@784  = ~When they saw me traveling alone, they approached me and we starting talking. They had lost their ship and were trying to reach the port of Azuza in neighboring Tu Lung.~
@785  = ~Of course, I did not reveal the full story of the monastery but just that I had had enough of a cloistered life and had decided to become an adventurer.~
@786  = ~Why did you hide the truth from these merchants? I feel you had nothing to be ashamed of.~
@787  = ~One can't be too cautious.~
@788  = ~I guess.. They did not know your whole life.~
@789  = ~It was the first offer of help I'd received, and I didn't want to frighten them. The fact that I was expelled from a reputable monastery in Koryo could have raised many suspicions on their part. Let me continue my tale...~
@790  = ~The fact that I was expelled from a reputable monastery in Koryo could have raised a lot of suspicions on their part, but let me continue my tale...~
@791  = ~They told me the road to Tu Lung was unsafe and that my fighting skills could prove useful to them. To convince me, they added that they would pay good money if I escorted them to Azusa.~
@792  = ~We traveled without incident to Asuza, nothing aside from a few bandits and gibberlings, which proved to be no match for my skills.~
@793  = ~They were so impressed that they also asked me to join them on their boat trip to Afyal. Since I had little else to do and was quite eager to discover their island, I accepted their offer.~
@794  = ~It must have proven a valuable experience and quite an adventure...~
@795  = ~I am sure your skills in the martial arts must have impressed these simple merchants~
@796  = ~I am sure a bit of money in your precarious condition was of great help...~
@797  = ~The cloistered life was nice and offered a lot of practice in martial arts, but we never fought to kill, only to defend.~
@798  = ~I am sure your skills in the martial arts must have impressed these simple merchants.~
@799  = ~So, what happened when you arrived in Afyal?~
@800  = ~The flying gibberling is probably what impressed them most. On one of them, my blow was so forceful that the creature literally flew into the air, landing on a nearby tree.~
@801  = ~Well, I couldn't really refuse their generous offer, but the chance to discover the world was also very tempting.~
@802  = ~Perhaps later, I shall tell you of how I met Zaiya and of her affliction.~
@803  = ~Would you like to know how I met Zaiya and how she was afflicted with this terrible curse?~
@804  = ~Yes, definitely. I was actually wondering when you'd tell us about Zaiya's strange affliction.~
@805  = ~It seems interesting enough.~
@806  = ~On arrival at Medina al Afyal, the merchants paid me one hundred gold as agreed. Before parting, I asked them for directions to the nearest inn and spent the rest of the evening asleep.~
@807  = ~The next day I went to a temple, as I needed a few herbs and some time in meditation. This is where I met Zaiya. She had just been struck by a terrible curse and was seeking help from the local temples, but it seemed all her attempts had failed. Perhaps it would be best if she relates this dreadful event.~
@808  = ~Fine, I wouldn't say no.~
@809  = ~Zaiya and I stay together. She has pledged herself as my servant ever since, though I did not force this decision upon her. She just had little choice in the matter.~
@810  = ~Reading books on poison is not truly something sensible to do.~
@811  = ~How did you perform such an amazing feat, Kiara?~
@812  = ~Her affliction is truly peculiar. Nobody ever managed to cure her.~
@813  = ~Zaiya is extremely curious and I guess it was her innocent fascination with magic that led her to her infirmity. She is truly sensitive about it and does not really wish to say more.~
@814  = ~Her affliction is truly peculiar. Has nobody ever managed to cure her?~
@815  = ~So, what does Zaiya do as your servant?~
@816  = ~I am able to focus my Ki energies for a short period and stabilize Zaiya's condition. Without this, she will die. My energies seem to neutralize the curse for a short while.~
@817  = ~It is only temporary, however, and I must apply my hands to her almost everyday.~
@818  = ~Reading dark books is not truly something sensible to do.~
@819  = ~But how did you two come to Athkatla?~
@820  = ~We have sought the advice of many powerful clerics. We have visited many temples, but haven't found any cure yet.~
@821  = ~Zaiya had little choice but to stay with me, else she would die. When Zaiya proposed to be my servant in exchange for her life, I almost laughed but accepted nevertheless.~
@822  = ~Besides, the combination of our forces has proven valuable at times.~
@823  = ~Not enough to prevent your somehow getting sold into slavery. What happened?~
@824  = ~This is another long tale so I will tell you of it the next time we speak.~
@825  = ~Would you like to know how we became slaves?~
@826  = ~Sure, this should be quite interesting.~
@827  = ~Why not?~
@828  = ~It seems like a gruesome tale, I wouldn't really want to hear it.~
@829  = ~All the herbalists and clerics we approached almost ruined us with their expenses. We decided to try our luck with a tasked Djinn. He was not able to offer much by way of help, but did offer us some advice.~
@830  = ~He said some extraordinary herbs grew in the land of Maztica and that we might find a cure there. Trade between Afyal and Maztica was so unusual that our hopes grew thinner.. As a last resort, we went to see those merchants I escorted from Koryo and asked them if they could help us travel to Maztica.~
@831  = ~They looked at me with genuine surprise at such a request but soon offered to help us reach Qudra, the city of power, on mainland Zakhara. From there, it would be much easier to find a ship traveling to Maztica.~
@832  = ~Off the shorelines of Qudra, our ship was boarded by corsairs who later sold us to slavers in Athkatla.~
@833  = ~Even a genie was not able to help?~
@834  = ~Another great adventure of yours, I believe...~
@835  = ~You know more of Toril than I'll ever find out...~
@836  = ~I assure you there is nothing as such in my tale.~
@837  = ~Not all genies will grant you a wish, <CHARNAME>.~
@838  = ~Months of travel in a tiny cabin, then later being chained in the hold of a corsair ship is an adventure I would have gladly skipped.~
@839  = ~Considering we spent most of our time at sea, yes, we know pretty much what *water* looks like.~
@840  = ~When you found me, I had been sold to Amaralis. Luckily you found Zaiya before the worst could happen to her. One of the reasons I decided to travel with you was not so much my desire for freedom or adventure, but the story foretold by an old prophetess. We met her whilst searching for a cure in Afyal. She sensed something in me but wouldn't tell me anything of it.~
@841  = ~After asking a lot of questions about my life, she said I was soon to meet a powerful Bhaalspawn. That's when I stopped listening to her. I should have been more attentive when she related the tale of the Bhaalspawn and the prophecy of Alaundo.~
@842  = ~So, this prophecy is about you and I after all! Why didn't you tell me so?~
@843  = ~Did she say what would happen if you tried to corrupt me?~
@844  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I lied to you. I don't want you to conclude that I am a liar. I was just unsure about the way you would react to this prophecy.~
@845  = ~Did she say what kind of consequences awaited you?~
@846  = ~Did she say anything about me?~
@847  = ~I am afraid she did not. She said something terrible would happen but refused to say more.~
@848  = ~I'll need time to think about what you have told me, Kiara.~
@849  = ~She did not say anything either.~
@850  = ~Did she mention the consequences that awaited you?~
@851  = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, why did you come to my rescue? Perhaps you entertained the thought of having a pleasure slave at your disposal?~
@852  = ~I hadn't envisioned it that way, but now that you mention it, it is indeed an interesting proposal...~
@853  = ~I am not interested in discussing my motives with you, Kiara.~
@854  = ~No, I would never think of you like this, Kiara.~
@855  = ~What a curious thought!~
@856  = ~You have been mistaken, <CHARNAME>. Zaiya and I were abducted by corsairs but only meant to be sold in Athkatla. Besides Amaralis was not really interested in me physically; he had other schemes in mind.~
@857  = ~So, it might come as a disappointment but I would make a poor pleasure slave for the Lord of Murder, wouldn't I?~
@858  = ~The motives may seem unclear, but I wouldn't want to be seen as an ungrateful woman.~
@859  = ~I am glad to hear it. Besides, I must tell you that Zaiya and I were abducted by corsairs but only meant to be sold in Athkatla. Amaralis was not really interested in me physically; he had other schemes in mind.~
@860  = ~I hadn't found the time to thank you. I might as well do it now. (Kiara walks towards you and unexpectedly kisses your cheek.)~
@861  = ~Don't blush, <CHARNAME>, it makes me feel embarrassed too. I simply wished to show you how grateful I am.~
@862  = ~Well, I must admit that I did like that...I haven't had many women expressing their gratitude in such an open manner.~
@863  = ~I am not really blushing...It's just getting a little hot, too much walking under the sun, I guess.~
@864  = ~Don't do it so often in public, please.~
@865  = ~It was really unnecessary...I help people in need whenever I can but I do seek any reward.~
@866  = ~Though we wouldn't want to do this too often. It will be far less appealing once you get accustomed to it.~
@867  = ~Your shyness is touching. Such a strong man, braving the dangers of a dragon and the wrath of the slaver's guild, all this to come to my rescue...I almost feel that my signs of gratitude aren't enough for such a mighty masculine specimen...~
@868  = ~Well, you should from time to time expect a bit of gratitude from those who you've helped.~
@869  = ~You are a child of a destructive force. Enemies have fallen at your whim and those who know you, fear you.  But tell me, my Lord of Murder, have you the skill to add a sensual conquest to you marvelous exploits?~
@870  = ~Have you a hand that can show a woman a rare tenderness as well as it levels its foes?~
@871  = ~Have you an eye that knows the pleasurable parts of a body as well as it knows those that cause it pain?~
@872  = ~Are you challenging me, Kiara?~
@873  = ~Ha ha ha. And who might this sensual conquest be?~
@874  = ~A shared attraction, then, and a challenge it shall be!~
@875  = ~I would have gladly taken up the gauntlet, but this prophecy of yours has far too many implications.~
@876  = ~I haven't really the time for such frivolous concerns.~
@877  = ~That is, if you feel up to the task!~
@878  = ~...I have gazed and marveled at your beauty for so long.. Nothing could be more pleasing, Kiara.~
@879  = ~I would have gladly taken up the gauntlet but this prophecy of yours has far too many implications...~
@880  = ~I have no such frivolous interests.~
@881  = ~Who else but the one who openly challenges you, my Lord of Murder?~
@882  = ~...I have gazed and marveled at your beauty. Nothing could be more pleasing, Kiara.~
@883  = ~I have no such frivolous interest.~
@884  = ~I promise you the challenge will be rewarding...for I shall make a domain for the conqueror of my heart where love shall rule, lust shall be queen and where he shall be king.~
@885  = ~A heaven filled with love and joy where exquisite pleasures equally match the tender moments, where moments of great passion will follow in sweet and blissful oblivion...~
@886  = ~A place where our sorrows shall dry in the heat of passion, where our burdens shall be become lighter than feathers and our pains will vanish in the many comforts of love...~
@887  = ~A place where one could easily feel at ease and of which I shall be an ardent defender.~
@888  = ~My interest has faltered...~
@889  = ~Then it should be more daunting and challenging than you first thought. Do you fear Kiara would be your superior when in your veins flows the blood of the divine?~
@890  = ~If you'd tell me more about the rewards, I might let myself be convinced despite my earlier reticence...~
@891  = ~I haven't really the time for such frivolous chatter, Kiara.~
@892  = ~Taking up such challenge would bring you great rewards, ones that would match the expectation of a Bhaalspawn such as yourself.~
@893  = ~If you'd tell me more about the rewards, I might let myself be convinced despite my earlier reticence...~
@894  = ~Your heart must have turned to stone. Should I ask Zaiya to use a stone to flesh spell on you?~
@895  = ~That won't be necessary. I'll take up your gauntlet, Kiara.~
@896  = ~No, leave me be.~
@897  = ~Not so fast, my fiery prince. Your kingship deserves a rule of hardship first...and I would certainly enjoy the pleasures of courtship before opening to you the doors of my heaven.~
@898  = ~I shall indulge you with all the flame and passion of a true admirer of your loveliness...~
@899  = ~I must warn you I have had little experience with the fairer sex, and am likely speak as a blunt tool.~
@900  = ~We shall see, and I certainly look forward to it upon our next conversation, <CHARNAME>.~
@901  = ~Very well then, I shall sharpen my passion and eagerly await the opportunity to start the challenge.~
@902  = ~Though, I must warn you I have had little experience with the fairer sex, and am likely speak as a blunt tool.~
@903  = ~I shall reward the sincerity and the effort. I would have none of a frivolous and superficial courtship.~
@904  = ~Do you admire Kiara's alabaster skin and fiery hair? Do her exquisite body and sparkling eyes fill your nights with ravishing desires to hold her in your arms?~
@905  = ~We are back to the challenge, aren't we?~
@906  = ~May I hold your hand, Kiara, whilst I relate to you some of my adventures?~
@907  = ~I would rather do that now than wait for the evening...~
@908  = ~Any word, no matter how sweet and flattering, could only poorly describe your beauty. I wouldn't want to perform such an injustice...~
@909  = ~I am not going to fall prey to any of your mind games, Kiara.~
@910  = ~I haven't the time for this.~
@911  = ~Are you going to bore me with yet more questions? I thought you would entice me with fervor and passion. I must have been mistaken.~
@912  = ~I apologize, Kiara. May I hold your hand whilst I relate some of my adventures?~
@913  = ~Could I hold you in my arms?~
@914  = ~Any word, no matter how sweet and flattering, could only poorly describe your beauty. I can only admire it, stricken silent by the radiance of your loveliness.~
@915  = ~I am eager to hear some of your tale, <CHARNAME>. I would gladly hear the one about your half brother Sarevok and how you brilliantly averted a war with Amn.~
@916  = ~(Kiara allows you to hold her hand whilst you tell her about your previous adventures.)~
@917  = ~I don't know what to say...~
@918  = ~I hope I haven't bored you with my past exploits.~
@919  = ~You are rushing through a lovely garden like a ruffian, trampling its beauties and creating havoc. I was expecting something far more subtle from a potential suitor, especially a powerful Bhaalspawn such as you. Was I wrong in my estimate of you?~
@920  = ~My apologies, Kiara. May I hold your hand whilst I relate some of my adventures?~
@921  = ~It is sweet, but your words seem dubious rather than sincere.~
@922  = ~I assure you I had no intentions of being deceptive. If you discerned frivolity in my attempt, it was not my prime intention.~
@923  = ~A mere blunder. Did I ever tell you about my own past?~
@924  = ~I did not force on you this challenge...If you find it too difficult, we can put an end to it right now. But do not be such a bad loser by falsely accusing me of toying with your mind.~
@925  = ~Yes, let's put an end to it.~
@926  = ~You do have a real talent to bringing these tales alive, <CHARNAME>. If only half your tale is true then you would certainly deserve the highest honors.~
@927  = ~I have not tried to embellish the tale. I only relate to you the truth about my own past...~
@928  = ~Blunder upon blunder. I was expecting something far more subtle from a suitor, especially a Bhaalspawn.~
@929  = ~You have already given up. I thought you would be more resilient. I was probably mistaken about your nature.~
@930  = ~I have no time and I mean it, Kiara.~
@931  = ~My apologies. May I hold your hand, my lady, whilst I relate to you some of my adventures?~
@932  = ~I shall not question your sincerity further, but tell me, besides the physical facade, what trait of my personality attracts you most?~
@933  = ~Is it Kiara's mysterious prophecy, her strong yet relaxed personality, her unabashed sexuality, her intelligence, her sense of humor or perhaps a combination of all of them?~
@934  = ~Your strong personality is truly appealing and I certainly don't envision a woman that couldn't match my skills.~
@935  = ~Your sensuality and unabashed sexuality provide a tantalizing provocation for many men to which I am also sensitive.~
@936  = ~Your mysterious past and this prophecy are intriguing...~
@937  = ~You are certainly cunning and convincing at times Kiara...Very appealing considering we have to face so many dangers.~
@938  = ~I like your sense of humor Kiara.~
@939  = ~None of them really describe you well.~
@940  = ~A woman that could match the skills of the Bhaalspawn you say? Shall I answer the challenge next time?~
@941  = ~I would look forward to that, Kiara.~
@942  = ~So, is this a purely sexual desire? You went into the challenge with the mere idea of getting Kiara in a bed. You are an animal, <CHARNAME>! Your prime instincts are deplorable.~
@943  = ~You have certainly showed a daring personality despite the prophecy's warning. Are you not afraid of what it says?~
@944  = ~Have I cause to fear you Kiara?~
@945  = ~I sometimes feel you know more than you really say.~
@946  = ~I am glad you see me as useful, my Lord of Murder.~
@947  = ~I have not yet shown much of my skills on this side, the opportunity never truly arose. Obviously your interest is blurred and confused.~
@948  = ~Another blunder that puts shame on your title of Lord of Murder.~
@949  = ~You should trust your instincts. If they lead you towards liking me even with your fears of what may or may not happen, then you should keep the challenge going.~
@950  = ~I might need time to think over it.~
@951  = ~You prove too great a danger.~
@952  = ~Is that so? The Lord of Murder somehow feels threatened by a woman of humble condition.  Do you think that, perhaps I should leave?~
@953  = ~No, I am not afraid of you.~
@954  = ~No, though I will keep a watchful eye on you, Kiara.~
@955  = ~Didn't we say last time that I should prove I am your match, my Lord of Murder?~
@956  = ~You are choosing a difficult path but an interesting one, Kiara...~
@957  = ~I doubt you ever will.~
@958  = ~You have the kind of musculature that makes a women swoon with desire, chiseled and hardened through countless fights and hardship.~
@959  = ~Your fighting skills are extremely impressive and surpass my own.~
@960  = ~A fiery prince that would not shy wielding his sword and rush to battle to rescue his beloved one.~
@961  = ~I am certain you will find myself to be a woman that can match you in every way.~
@962  = ~So much is true, but mere flattery shall not have me convinced...~
@963  = ~Your intelligence is no doubt an attraction for every sensible woman looking for a match to her own wits. You have proven, my Lord of Murder, to use words far more cunningly than would any man with a sword.~
@964  = ~An attraction I certainly fail to resist and as you can see I do not lack of them either.~
@965  = ~I envy your wisdom, my Lord of Murder. That would have allowed me to escape a few troubles and inconveniences.~
@966  = ~But perhaps under your guided hand could I learn to control my passion.~
@967  = ~You are a cunning one, my Lord of Murder, and as such you probably already know that having a women with some wits at your side could prove useful.~
@968  = ~You are quick in changing you mind and I shall be prompt to put an end to the challenge.~
@969  = ~The challenge remains on you, <CHARNAME>. I was merely pointing at my attraction to you and the reasons as to why our union could be a powerful one.~

@971  = ~So, tell me, what kind of kingdom shall you lay at the feet of your beloved one?~
@972  = ~What kind of kingdom would you wish for, Kiara?~
@973  = ~I shall strive to satisfy your every wish my lady. Just tell me how you would wish things to be.~
@974  = ~You are bringing up another challenge, but before I answer, can you detail for me your preferences?~
@975  = ~(A malicious smile flits across Kiara's face.) I hope half of Faerun is not overly ambitious for my Lord of Murder.~
@976  = ~(grin) Not at all... As long as your dowry entails half of Kara-Tur!~
@977  = ~Are you serious??~
@978  = ~You are a woman with rather expensive and ambitious tastes.~
@979  = ~(A malicious smile flits across Kiara's face.) Then I take it that asking for half of Faerun is not overly ambitious for my Lord of Murder.~
@980  = ~Are you serious?~
@981  = ~Such a large empire may be to my taste but will leave us both very little time. I might settle for Amn and the Sword Coast. The climate here is mild and has proven to be quite...invigorating.~
@982  = ~Amn and the Sword coast. Hum...We're sure to live in peace in both of them after all the clean up I've done over the past year.~
@983  = ~Of course. Didn't you ask me what I wished for?~
@984  = ~Am I not worth them?~
@985  = ~I wouldn't want a jewel such as yourself be left without a proper mounting nor should I want my queen to be seen without her crown...~
@986  = ~Joking aside <CHARNAME>, does your divine essence hold some ambitions of its own?  Do you seek to match the station of your father and use the divinity coursing through your body?~
@987  = ~Often, I have to refrain myself from the swarming desire to carve an empire of my own...~
@988  = ~Yes, but I doubt that a refined woman such as yourself would like its murderous streak.~
@989  = ~You shouldn't fetter nature's call. Let your taint be the guide to those less gifted in the ways of leadership.~
@990  = ~I have no intentions in letting the taint become neither my leader nor that of other.~
@991  = ~Perhaps. Though I do not wish to be my father's son.~
@992  = ~I thought that perhaps such a streak could be turned to more positive ambitions such as gaining the power and respect of those around you.~
@993  = ~I think I've earned their respect already and that few would dare challenge my powers openly.~
@994  = ~I have no ambitions whatsoever to lord over others, Kiara, if this is what you imply.~
@995  = ~Such a sphere of influence is definitely to my liking and I believe, Kiara, that you would want to be my trusted advisor?~
@996  = ~Real power is to influence the masses and their lives, serving as both their leader and guide. The power by which you crush your enemies is enough to earn you such an influential position. If you'd truly desire it, that is.~
@997  = ~I have no ambitions whatsoever to lord over others, Kiara.~
@998  = ~And nothing could be please me more but to have you rule at my side.~
@999  = ~A sign of weakness?? Totally unexpected from a Bhaalspawn. I'd never thought that of you.~
@1000 = ~I never imagined that you could lack ambition and thirst for power. Leave me be will you...~
@1001 = ~Such ambitions are rightly yours, the power and prestige afforded by your blood ensure this...though nothing could please me more but to contribute to your glorious ascension, my Lord of Murder.~
@1002 = ~And nothing could please me more than have you rule by my side.~
@1003 = ~Your ambitions will kill you, Kiara. Seeking power can only lead to deception...~
@1004 = ~As much as you do, I do not wish to unleash the powers of the dead god of murder, though with a bit of guidance its energy may prove useful if not worthy.~
@1005 = ~Your words are music to my ears. It seems you are not far from winning this challenge of ours.~
@1006 = ~I prefer deception to living the life of a heedless cattle grazing on mediocrity.~
@1007 = ~Are you hungry, <CHARNAME>?  Come, let's sit at a table and have something to eat.~
@1008 = ~Very well, I feel quite hungry myself. Let's go and sit over there.~
@1009 = ~I'm not hungry, but if you insist.~
@1010 = ~(After being served a copious meal, you suddenly feel something tickling your right foot, rubbing and caressing it gently. At first you think of a rat, but Kiara is staring at you across the table with a suggestive smile. You realize that Kiara's bare foot is toying with yours.)~
@1011 = ~(Her small foot slowly moves up past your ankle, caressing your leg, finally reaching your loins. You feel her rub her foot through your pants, gently pressing it back and forth over the cool slick leather, her toe slipping briefly over the prominent rim of your manhood before sliding down the shaft once more.)~
@1012 = ~(She brutally stops and rest her foot on your leg, her next words declared for the entire world to hear.) . After all this walking, I'd really enjoy a foot massage.~
@1013 = ~(With a subtle movement, you slip one hand under the table and start gently to rub her foot. You see her smile once more, but this time from heartfelt pleasure.)~
@1014 = ~(Push Kiara's foot away.)~
@1015 = ~(After being served a copious meal, you suddenly feel something tickling your right foot, rubbing and caressing it gently. At first you think of a rat, but Kiara is staring at you across the table with a malicious smile. You realize that Kiara's bare foot is toying with yours.~
@1016 = ~(You feel her foot slowly moving up your ankle, your leg, finally reaching your loins. You feel her rub her foot through your pants, gently pressing it back and forth over the cool slick leather.~
@1017 = ~( Surreptitiously, you slip one hand under the table and start gently to rub her foot. You see her smile once more, but this time from heartfelt pleasure.)~
@1018 = ~Yes, I could eat a horse.~
@1019 = ~Very well then, let's sit over there then and have something to eat~
@1020 = ~I've never seen somebody eating so much. Does your appetite in sensual matters and the diplomacy of the bedchambers equal that of the table?~
@1021 = ~Pardon me?~
@1022 = ~No, nothing really.~
@1023 = ~Humph....~
@1024 = ~Perhaps our last meal in this inn has upset your stomach?~
@1025 = ~Or do you have another reason for keeping a constipated face?~
@1026 = ~It is not funny, Kiara. I have troubles on my mind...~
@1027 = ~Something is troubling me. Besides, I fail to understand how you are so eager to develop a new relationship when you lost your love Osan in such a brutal fashion.~
@1028 = ~Leave me Kiara, I wish to be alone.~
@1029 = ~I believe the loss of your foster father, Gorion, for whom you could do nothing was a tragedy enough. But facing a similar fate for your own sister must be truly horrible.~
@1030 = ~It saddens me to see you at such a loss sometimes...and I wish I could do something to take some of your burdens..~
@1031 = ~Leave me be, Kiara~
@1032 = ~Tell me, Kiara, how did you get over the loss of Osan? It seems you are no longer *affected* by his death.~
@1033 = ~Fine <CHARNAME>, I thought we had some kind of bond and friendship developing. It saddens me to think you wish to cloister yourself rather than let others help you.~
@1034 = ~It is my own choice and I do not wish to discuss it.~
@1035 = ~I wept an ocean of tears after Osan's death and truly felt at a loss. But I have found much comfort in the reassuring thought that the man who did this shall one day pay dearly for my loss.~
@1036 = ~You mean to sate your need for revenge over this Balthazar. You should consider that the taste of revenge is sour and is likely to leave you empty.~
@1037 = ~I wish I had the same motivations. Perhaps it would make my life easier.~
@1038 = ~You may be right, but I will have the consolation of having avenged Osan and honored his memory...~
@1039 = ~Even if you needed crutches to get over Osan's death, and I fully understand you had a need to hang on to something, shouldn't it be time you let go?~
@1040 = ~I see no honor in a bloody revenge that in the end will prove painful and leave your soul empty. You should look at other goals and set aside this need for revenge.~
@1041 = ~And with what should I replace my thirst for revenge?~
@1042 = ~Well, I am here for a start. Perhaps we can help each other...~
@1043 = ~As much as you overcame Osan's loss, you should be able to overcome your desire for revenge.~
@1044 = ~I believe the hatred you bear for Irenicus is similar to my own for Balthazar.~
@1045 = ~I am merely chasing him to get my sister back, which is in itself a good reason. But you are chasing Balthazar for a reason that will get you no reward.~
@1046 = ~I know Irenicus wants something and the confrontation is inevitable. But you have a choice not to confront Balthazar if you do not wish to, Kiara.~
@1047 = ~I have learned to appreciate your kindness. Sometimes the passion with which you face life and the patience you have showed.. For all this, I bear the greatest respect and gratitude...~
@1048 = ~(Kiara leans towards you and kisses your cheek, her lips feather-light against your skin.)~
@1049 = ~(Take Kiara in your arms and kiss her passionately.)~
@1050 = ~(Kiss Kiara's soft, pale cheek.)~
@1051 = ~These are kind words Kiara and I appreciate having a friend like you...~
@1052 = ~I did overcome the loss of Osan but do not wish to let go of my feelings for Balthazar.~
@1053 = ~Perhaps you are right to keep such feelings going. I will help should you need it, Kiara.~
@1054 = ~Then there is nothing much I can do to help you, Kiara.~
@1055 = ~Love can be prove a strong healer, <CHARNAME>. We really should keep going before the others start asking questions, though.~
@1056 = ~From the look on their faces, I think they know.~
@1057 = ~You are right, Kiara. Lead on woman!~
@1058 = ~Then friends we shall be, <CHARNAME>.~
@1059 = ~I am glad you think of me that way.~
@1060 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am not really tired. Won't you invite me to your room? We could have a glass of wine and a pleasant conversation...~
@1061 = ~Well, that is indeed a pleasant idea, Kiara .~
@1062 = ~I am very tired and wish you a good night..~
@1063 = ~Are you sure? I wouldn't want to be intrusive and will not insist further.~
@1064 = ~Well, I might not be that tired after all...~
@1065 = ~No, I am truly exhausted.~
@1066 = ~Let's move to your room, but we can't forget a bottle of this excellent Thayvian wine.~
@1067 = ~You are finally awake...The smile on your face tells me you are rather pleased this morning.~
@1068 = ~Yes,  for a long time I've not had such pleasant dreams.~
@1069 = ~Would you tell me about them?~
@1070 = ~I dreamt you were a siren and that we made love on a sandy beach the whole night long.  Our pleasures were sated and for a moment, in the throes of passion, we became as one.  The physical manifestation of our emotions was acted out time and again under the starlit sky and the glowing moon..  It is a dream I have never experienced and the emotional consequences I feel from it are very real.~
@1071 = ~Except for the sand and my legs, the rest is true.. Emotions stir in me also, <CHARNAME>, although I am unsure of what they may be. Perhaps, the wine was a little strong, hmm?~
@1072 = ~I need to tell you something, <CHARNAME>.  Memories and feelings have come flooding to the surface recently, mostly due to my relationship with you.  Have...have I told you that I think I'm falling in love with you?~
@1073 = ~No, you haven't.~
@1074 = ~Tell me then Kiara.~
@1075 = ~A love declaration. I can't wait to hear it.~
@1076 = ~After Osan died, I thought I'd never fall in love again and certainly I didn't want to, but I now find myself in exactly that scenario.~
@1077 = ~You have proven more than a match to my every expectation and beyond. You are an exceptional being, <CHARNAME>.~
@1078 = ~I tell you this for a reason, <CHARNAME>.  You should know that you bear great risks staying with me or even keeping me in your group.~
@1079 = ~I already felt you were trying to use me or needed me for some kind of trick of yours...~
@1080 = ~Kiara, you'd already warned me through this prophecy of yours. Though I'd really would like an explanation as a matter of trust in our relationship.~
@1081 = ~A great evil is behind this scheme and used me in order to get to you. He has placed a weight upon my shoulders, a weight that I do not wish to carry any longer. I..I am under penalty of death for either revealing to you my great burden or failing in the task I have been set.~
@1082 = ~I really feel at a loss, <CHARNAME>. I truly love you and have no desire to hurt you. For me, death is the only honorable release.  I can brook no harm to you..~
@1083 = ~No, I love you far too much to let go of you so easily, Kiara... But what should we do?~
@1084 = ~Alone, I would probably take the risk but I cannot endanger those who have also placed their trust in my hands. I...I'm sorry.~
@1085 = ~Can you tell me more about this great evil and his scheme? Perhaps, I could help you.~
@1086 = ~So, what can I do to relieve some of your burden?~
@1087 = ~You certainly hid your ploy well...~
@1088 = ~I understand my love...Please, remember me...~
@1089 = ~(Kiara walks back facing you. A tear in her eye runs down her cheek. She tries to smile but as you see it flicker off of her face you realize she is consigned to defeat. She clearly shakes in the knowledge that she is facing her final moments of life.)~
@1090 = ~If I did so, the death penalty would be enacted immediately. Is it your wish my love?~
@1091 = ~No, I love you too much to let go of you, Kiara...But again, I ask you. What should we do?~
@1092 = ~Alone, I would probably take the risk but I can not endanger those who have also placed their trust in my hands.~
@1093 = ~Nothing...Nothing can be done. I just needed to tell you...I had to warn you...and in itself it proves to be a small relief.~
@1094 = ~I truly wish I could tell you more. This damn thing is burning my lips and torturing my soul, but I can't...I just can't, <CHARNAME>.~
@1095 = ~I have faced many evils alone and you and I have faced many perils together. Why can't we just face this one?~
@1096 = ~It could prove far too dangerous and this could endanger others too. You prove too great a risk.~
@1097 = ~Well at first, I didn't know you, which made it easy to challenge your divine nature. But I have changed, <CHARNAME>, I swear to you on the blood of Osan and by the strength of my vengeance. I have changed.~
@1098 = ~I will accept death, welcome it, for you... if your love demands it of me.~
@1099 = ~Your deceptions prove too much a risk, Kiara.~
@1100 = ~There is no need of it, but what should we do now?~
@1101 = ~He is beyond mortal powers and any powers of this plane. Only a god or a demi god could possibly challenge him. He is far more dangerous than whatever creatures you have ever faced.~
@1102 = ~It could prove far too dangerous then, and this could endanger others too. You prove too great a risk.~
@1103 = ~I am not afraid of him regardless. I have the strength and determination of Bhaal in my veins and the woman I love by my side. I shall thwart whatever vile schemes he has devised.~
@1104 = ~(Kiara falls in your arms and you hold her tight, uncertain of what your future holds.  Images and recent memories flood your memory and your body warms to the feelings of this new experience.  After all of the turmoil following the death of Gorion you finally feel you have found a kindred spirit.)~
@1105 = ~<CHARNAME>, the time has come. I shall tell you everything now...~
@1106 = ~Sure, Kiara. I will listen to you.~
@1107 = ~I wonder if I really want to hear the truth, Kiara.~
@1108 = ~Then say it and delay no more.  I hope that this will explain why my mood has darkened and my mind now considers malevolent deeds it wouldn't have before...~
@1109 = ~You had warned me but I did not expect to fall prey to my taint. What have you done, Kiara?~
@1110 = ~I should relate something else first..~
@1111 = ~A while ago, soon after I was ousted from the monastery, I prayed to the gods for an opportunity for revenge on Balthazar.~
@1112 = ~The answer came not from a source of holy divinity but in the form of a Demon Lord...~
@1113 = ~He offered the possibility of revenge but this was weighted against my very own soul and an action of some sort.~
@1114 = ~I was ready to do anything at that time to obtain revenge on Balthazar. My feelings were that strong. I...I accepted his offer.~
@1115 = ~I can only imagine on what this action might be.~
@1116 = ~What kind of deal did you accept?~
@1117 = ~What kind of foul deal did you consent to?~
@1118 = ~I can only imagine what this action might be.~
@1119 = ~He said that one day I would be traveling with a Bhaalspawn and asked me to corrupt him, to despoil what goodness he struggled to maintain and to make him realize the potential in his own blood.~
@1120 = ~What did he mean by corrupting?~
@1121 = ~You failed, didn't you. So what now?~
@1122 = ~So, this explains why my mood has darkened and my mind now considers malevolent deeds it wouldn't have before...~
@1123 = ~Such treachery will not go unpunished.~
@1124 = ~The demon instructed me to turn a Bhaalspawn with a good soul into an evil one. I do not know the reason for it, I swear.~
@1125 = ~So, what now?~
@1126 = ~What will happen to you, Kiara?~
@1127 = ~How?~
@1128 = ~What is you next treachery, Kiara?~
@1129 = ~I was young and naive, my heart rendered asunder by Osan's death...I deeply regret what I have done, but I cannot change the past.~
@1130 = ~(Kiara, crystal rivers of teardrops streaming down her lovely face, comes close to you, laying her head on your shoulder.)~
@1131 = ~(Hug Kiara, murmuring soothing sounds.) Shush...~
@1132 = ~(Push Kiara away.)~
@1133 = ~I must have inflicted a wound that will be hard to heal. Will you ever entertain the idea of forgiving me, <CHARNAME>?~
@1134 = ~You warned me about the consequences. In a sense I find it hard to blame you entirely...~
@1135 = ~I doubt I can ever forgive you this treachery...~
@1136 = ~I guess I can't blame you for what I have done to myself willingly.~
@1137 = ~Leave me alone, Kiara. I have nothing to say to you. Be grateful that I saved this skin of yours.~
@1138 = ~This won't be necessary. Are you not my servant now, bound by geas, and am I not your master?~
@1139 = ~I'm glad to see that not all is lost and that in your heart still beats kindness, passion and generosity. ~
@1140 = ~You are mistaken, Kiara. I am not blaming you, but I do not feel any kindness either.~
@1141 = ~I have bitterly accepted performing these horrible deeds because I loved you, Kiara and still do, but I feel the trust we once shared is gone.~
@1142 = ~Yes, but the sweet promises have proven to lead to a bitter reward, one fact I still dwell upon.~
@1143 = ~Didn't I warn you many times about the consequences? Did you not engage in a relationship with full knowledge of the facts?~
@1144 = ~Perhaps the Demon Lord managed to pervert your kindness after all. But did he also expunge the memories of the good times we have shared together?~
@1145 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, that this is not true. You have been compelled to these acts! Surely deep in your heart you must have kept remnants of your kindness..~
@1146 = ~Nothing is left except loathing and hatred. Are you not my servant now, bound by geas, and am I not your master?~
@1147 = ~Then it is as I feared. The Demon Lord not only changed your soul but your heart too.~ ~You shall find in me a trusted servant, my Lord of Murder. I shall gladly help you vanquish your enemies, help you to attain power but do not expect the favors of my bed.~
@1148 = ~You are no longer the man I truly loved.~
@1149 = ~Indeed, my fate is sealed and I have lost more than I thought I ever would. I would rather die than yield my heart to a despot. It is as I feared, the change has clearly taken its toll.~
@1150 = ~You shall find in me a trusted servant, my Lord of Murder. I shall gladly help you vanquish your enemies, help you attain the power you now seemingly crave, but do not expect the favors of my bed.~
@1151 = ~Then you might as well take your leave this instant.~
@1152 = ~A fair deal. But one more treachery and I shall not be so lenient.~
@1153 = ~Forgive me, Kiara, I did not mean it...~
@1154 = ~Although I accept your apologies, your attempt to regain the favors of my heart is fruitless.~
@1155 = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>, but our love might prove stronger than the obstacles laid before us by a Demon Lord...~
@1156 = ~I just wish you'd let me revive the passion with which you enflamed my heart and captured my imagination.~
@1157 = ~Forget it, the passion is long gone.~
@1158 = ~Many more obstacles lie ahead of you before we can look to revive our relationship.~
@1159 = ~You are asking for the impossible.~
@1160 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, that this is not true. You have been compelled to these acts! Surely deep in your heart you must have kept remnants of your kindness.~
@1161 = ~Nothing is left except loathing and hatred.~
@1162 = ~The sweet promises have proven to lead to a bitter reward, one fact I still dwell upon.~
@1163 = ~I wish I could undo the past but this is impossible. I can make an attempt to salvage our relationship but only if you let me.  For this, for US to work, your soul as well as mine must be willing.~
@1164 = ~I have bitterly accepted performing these horrible deeds because I loved you, Kiara, and still I do, but I feel the trust I placed in you is gone.~
@1165 = ~I don't think I can, Kiara.~
@1166 = ~Then... just tell me you still love me still and love me purely, <CHARNAME>, and I shall be patient with your heart...~
@1167 = ~I cannot say those words. You are asking too much of me.~
@1168 = ~I..I love you, Kiara...~
@1169 = ~It seems the schemes of the Demon Lord have worked beyond his expectations.~
@1170 = ~My doom and suffering are greater than I had ever expected.~
@1171 = ~I love you too, <CHARNAME>...~
@1172 = ~<CHARNAME>, I miss a cozy night in your arms.~
@1173 = ~Nothing could please me more.~
@1174 = ~I cannot, Kiara.~
@1175 = ~Let me show you some new tricks, my love...some mysterious and cunning tricks from my homeland.~
@1176 = ~I wish we would stay in this bed forever.~
@1177 = ~Unfortunately, we have still a lot to do, like finding Irenicus.~
@1178 = ~I do wish it too. However, I have to get my soul back...~
@1179 = ~(sigh) You're right. We'll find more occasions in the future, I guess.~
@1180 = ~I have already forgiven you, Kiara. One must look at the future rather than the past.~
@1181 = ~Your hatred for Balthazar blinded you and the Demon Lord clearly exploited that weakness. I am glad to see a new Kiara at my side.~
@1182 = ~I am happy you feel this way. I...I...was so afraid to lose you, my love.~
@1183 = ~It was not love at first, was it? When did your feelings change, Kiara, or should I ask why?~
@1184 = ~What did really happen when you met the Demon Lord, Kiara?~
@1185 = ~Though you did warn me, I still find it hard to trust you, Kiara.~
@1186 = ~So much is true, but the recent events have exceeded all I imagined possible. Above all I do not trust you anymore.~
@1187 = ~Forget it, Kiara, I am not falling for your tricks any longer. Leave me be.~
@1188 = ~Aye, you did. Or at least you tried, I guess.~
@1189 = ~I am happy you feel this way. I wished this would have never happened but in the end I am most grateful to have found you, my love.~
@1190 = ~It was not love at first sight, was it? When did your feelings change, Kiara, or should I ask why?~
@1191 = ~Forget it, the passion is long gone. Leave me be.~
@1192 = ~It is as I feared: the Demon Lord's vile schemes have not failed entirely...~
@1193 = ~I wish I could undo the past, but this is impossible. I can make an attempt to salvage our relationship but only if you let me. For this, for US to work, your soul as well as mine must be willing.~
@1194 = ~You will have to give me some time, Kiara.~
@1195 = ~I feel empty inside and have no wish to put any efforts in a relationship that, it seems, was doomed from its beginning.~
@1196 = ~I love you more than life itself, <CHARNAME>.~
@1197 = ~I guess it wasn't love at first sight, was it? When did your feeling change, Kiara?~
@1198 = ~No, you're right, and looking at you from a new perspective, I still don't know why. You have too many scars, bathe too little, have grown a beard...I guess I fell in love with you, not your appearance.~
@1199 = ~You don't look bad either!~
@1200 = ~At least your sense of humor hasn't changed.~
@1201 = ~Can't you be serious just once and answer without the agility of a snake?~
@1202 = ~I met him right after leaving the monastery...I was in tears and lost. HE just appeared from nowhere. I was startled and afraid at first but HE soon assured HE meant me no harm.~
@1203 = ~HE said he could help me in many ways but I had first to commit my soul to the abyss and swear allegiance to HIM.~
@1204 = ~I did. Then HE said he would come back soon and assign the first of my tasks. I did not see HIM for months but HE reappeared just before I met Zaiya.~
@1205 = ~Laughing, HE said HE had made some travel arrangements and that once I was at my destination, a powerful Bhaalspawn would come to my rescue.~
@1206 = ~Then all I had to do was to convince him to commit evil deeds whilst traveling with this child of Bhaal, adding that I'd better not fail HIM.~
@1207 = ~I guess from your story it wasn't love at first sight, was it? When did your feelings change, Kiara?~
@1208 = ~Yes, you're right we all look awful...It just that I haven't seen a mirror in ages so I wouldn't really know how I look.~
@1209 = ~But tell me, <CHARNAME>, how did you find yourself attracted to such an evil bitch?~
@1210 = ~Ah! It is hard to tell...~
@1211 = ~I did not perceive you as such, but rather saw a woman who needed help.~
@1212 = ~Your feminine charms, your wits and humor proved irresistible if not fatal.~
@1213 = ~This bitchy attitude was quite attractive at times.~
@1214 = ~Perhaps your mysterious side, the "femme fatale"...~
@1215 = ~You proved quite a challenge woman and I mean that in all senses!~
@1216 = ~I am glad you noticed that. *grin* Too much change all at once may prove hard on you. But tell me, <CHARNAME>, how did you find yourself attracted to such an evil bitch?~
@1217 = ~There is such a powerful force emanating from you, <CHARNAME>, which combined with your kindness and patience makes you somebody quite unique.~
@1218 = ~Bah! The *why?* is less important than the assurance such love exits.~
@1219 = ~I needed help?...Hum perhaps...But you did as well as I recall.~
@1220 = ~*grin* At least my charms did not kill you and we avoided the worst.~
@1221 = ~I should ask Zaiya to change me into a lich. Then you'd probably find more meanings to the word "bitch".~
@1222 = ~I should ask Zaiya to change me into a lich. Then you'd probably find more meanings to the expression "femme fatale".~
@1223 = ~Yes, but I hope we find the time to indulge ourselves with more tenderness.~
@1224 = ~But then it feels so good to be free...at last.~
@1225 = ~Won't you invite me to your room, <CHARNAME>?~
@1226 = ~Of course, I would be honored, Lady of my heart, if you deigned share my room.~
@1227 = ~I am not so sure...but if you promise me not to snore...~
@1228 = ~I am really tired, can't we just...~
@1229 = ~You devil! Let me get some of that wine we had last time. I'm sure you'll sleep like baby...~
@1230 = ~Goodnight then!~
@1231 = ~I really do wish it too, but I have to get my soul back...~
@1232 = ~There is no need for geas. My bond with <CHARNAME> is now far greater than the threat of death.~
@1233 = ~It means that after Balthazar's death, he will come back for me and at that exact point in time, claim my soul. But until then, I am yours...We should enjoy such moments together as much as possible...~
@1234 = ~Well, we could avoid Balthazar...he couldn't claim your soul then.~
@1235 = ~I won't let it happen...We'll fight him, we'll fight him *together* if need be.~
@1236 = ~We shall strive to keep fate at a distance...It could be many years before we meet this Balthazar~
@1237 = ~We might be able to avoid him but who knows how Demon might choose to provoke the encounter...~
@1238 = ~It is my fate, <CHARNAME>. I have sealed it with my own blood. Fighting such a powerful demon will certainly result in your own death. I do not want that, <CHARNAME>. Your fate, it seems, is far greater than that.~
@1239 = ~I hope we can...I really do.~
@1240 = ~I am so happy to be freed from this foul deal...Oh! <CHARNAME>, isn't this wonderful?~
@1241 = ~Yes, Kiara it is and I am very happy for you.~
@1242 = ~I have yet to decide on your treacherous attempt to pervert my soul.~
@1243 = ~Leave me be, Kiara!~
@1244 = ~I wish to protest. I have no wish to share the filth of this ranger. Besides, his story seems unconvincing and you may want to consider that the Cowled wizards may reward you with the location of your sister Imoen...~
@1245 = ~You could cover your nose until he takes a decent bath?~
@1246 = ~I doubt they will do so, and shall not kill a man in cold blood for this reason alone.~
@1247 = ~I doubt they will do so, and refuse to kill a man in cold blood for this reason alone.~
@1248 = ~Very funny, <CHARNAME>, though it may be less so when the Cowled wizards start chasing you,~
@1249 = ~Besides, I doubt the Cowled wizards are inclined to reveal Imoen's location. I find it also a poor reason to kill a man for this reason.~
@1250 = ~You would make a strange <PRO_LADYLORD> of Murder. He is a murderer himself and wanted as such, I understand your reluctance over killing him in cold blood, but he will be less trouble for you dead than alive.~
@1251 = ~The Cowled wizards might start chasing you if they learn you gave this man a chance to escape.~
@1252 = ~I fail to understand why you want this stranger dead.~
@1253 = ~Perhaps, you are right.~
@1254 = ~Perhaps so, but evidently the ranger is not to be trusted. He is a murderer himself and wanted as such. I understand your reluctance over killing him in cold blood, but he will be less trouble for you dead than alive.~
@1255 = ~The Cowled wizards might start chasing you if they learn, you gave this man a chance to escape.~
@1256 = ~I fail to understand your obstinacy in seeing a stranger dead.~
@1257 = ~I have no interest in seeing the ranger dead, but seek only to protect your own interests.~
@1258 = ~Perhaps you are right.~
@1259 = ~I feel I can quite take care of my own interest myself. I have done so for much of my life.~
@1260 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, I did not mean to offend you. Consider it as advice from a woman that has had more than her own share of trouble and would not want to see you more burdened than you already are.~
@1261 = ~I am unsure...~
@1262 = ~The choice is yours, but I would be displeased if you'd not consider my advice...~
@1263 = ~Your advice is well noted, Kiara, but I'd prefer to give the ranger a chance.~
@1264 = ~Fine, you may have me convinced.~
@1265 = ~Are you really let him go of him?~
@1266 = ~You are right. His body might be useful after all.~
@1267 = ~Yes, and this is definite~
@1268 = ~Why do you bother talking to them, <CHARNAME>? Hasn't Phaere warned us enough about the consequences? I certainly do not wish to be exposed to drow tortures.~
@1269 = ~There might be an honorable way out Kiara, I'm thinking...~
@1270 = ~You are right Kiara, time to die svirfneblin scum!~
@1271 = ~It may be better to know the enemy first.~
@1272 = ~You are willing to risk our lives in the underdark for a few deep gnomes!~
@1273 = ~You'd endanger your beloved one, she who has shared your adventures *and* your bed I might add, for a few lowly gnomes...~
@1274 = ~You know I am not like this, Kiara. I am trying to find an honorable way that may spare us from Phaere's wrath.~
@1275 = ~I didn't mean to, Kiara. Right, time to die svirfneblin scum!~
@1276 = ~Perhaps I should prepare some tea as well whilst you continue to have your chit-chat. Phaere may just as well start preparing her torture chamber.~
@1277 = ~I shall do as like, Kiara.~
@1278 = ~Do not take this tone with me.~
@1279 = ~I'm sorry Kiara. Yes, let's kill them all.~
@1280 = ~A way that will lead to disaster. I'm so afraid of these drow, <CHARNAME>. This place really makes feel uneasy. Let's kill these gnomes as Phaere instructed us and get out of here.~
@1281 = ~Fine, we shall do as you want if this can make you feel better.~
@1282 = ~I said no, and my decision is final.~
@1283 = ~I'm sorry, it's just that...this place is so scary and Phaere makes me so uneasy.~
@1284 = ~You reason just does not make sense.~
@1285 = ~What this women needs is a good slap in the face! Damn! If I wasn't a monk, you'd already see the red markings on both her cheeks.~
@1286 = ~Go ahead, Kiara. I've had enough with this ungrateful bitch.~
@1287 = ~Stay your hand, Kiara. She may be a real pain but I do not wish her death.~
@1288 = ~Fine, if you as a great Bhaalspawn like to be treated like dirt with small and unimportant people insulting you, I might as well give it a try too... I'm thinking about a few nicknames for you. What about the tiny Bhaalspawn, the puny Bhaalspawn...~
@1289 = ~You're right, Kiara. I've had enough from this ungrateful bitch.~
@1290 = ~There are other ways of earning people's respect, Kiara.~
@1291 = ~How dare you, Kiara!~
@1292 = ~Fine, let her treat you like dirt then, let her insult you and treat you as if you actually *are* beneath her. I might as well try it too. I'm thinking a about a few nicknames for you. What about <CHARNAME> Dirt, <CHARNAME> the mud lover...~
@1293 = ~How dare you, Kiara?~
@1294 = ~I was only trying to show you how people will treat you if you leave these insults unpunished. I have far more respect for you than you think and would like others to respect you for what you are.~
@1295 = ~No you're right, Kiara. I've had enough from this ungrateful bitch.~
@1296 = ~I shall control my anger, for now.~
@1297 = ~The ways you have chosen will obviously not lead to your fame, but rather to your shame.~
@1298 = ~No you're right, Kiara. I've had enough of this ungrateful bitch.  We save her pampered hide from almost certain death and absolute ruin and for what?~
@1299 = ~I can control my anger, for now.~
@1300 = ~*A small portion.* The wizard is clearly trying to swindle us.~
@1301 = ~I disagree, though I would indeed prefer a bit more too.~
@1302 = ~This prize appears large enough. He took most of the risks entering these portals.~
@1303 = ~I agree with you Kiara, the wizard needs a lesson.~
@1304 = ~I am glad you feel so too. But we should also wash this affront from ourselves in the wizard's blood.~
@1305 = ~No, Kiara! If he gives us a bit more I shall consider it a fair share of the booty.~
@1306 = ~No, I don't think it was intentional. We should ask him for a bit more and leave.~
@1307 = ~I agree with you, Kiara, the wizard should pay for trying to cheat us.~
@1308 = ~You first rescued him from a gruesome fate, then took great risks to find his book, without which he would have never been able to find anything, and THEN helped him out with the portal guardians.~
@1309 = ~And you're happy with some little rod!~
@1310 = ~For his ungratefulness, the man deserves to be sent back to from where he came from.~
@1311 = ~All that much is true, but I have no reason to kill him.~
@1312 = ~If we bargain with him, I'm sure we shall obtain a fair share.~
@1313 = ~All right, the wizard should pay for this affront.~
@1314 = ~Why do you wish to bargain with a swindler? His nature will oppose us thereby revealing to you what he truly found.~
@1315 = ~I doubt he took tremendous risks for a mere rod. There must something of great importance.~
@1316 = ~Let's not waste our time and find out by getting rid of this swindler.~
@1317 = ~You would kill the man on a mere assumption that he is trying to cheat us.~
@1318 = ~You're right, Kiara. Let's try and find out what the wizard is hiding.~
@1319 = ~No, let's bargain with him.~
@1320 = ~Without you he would have suffered eternal imprisonment. I do feel that his attempt to con us deserves that we send him back where he came from.~
@1321 = ~I shall have none of it. I'll ask him for a bit more though.~
@1322 = ~No, I shall not ask for more.~
@1323 = ~Right, let's kill the bastard.~
@1324 = ~She has nothing of value but a ransom is on its way! And she's not even offering us any reward for saving her skin.~
@1325 = ~I say we wait for the ransom and be offered a bit of recompense before we let go of her.~
@1326 = ~No, Kiara, she is free to go. I do not wish any harm to the lady. Besides we did not come here for this reason.~
@1327 = ~We wouldn't be much better than those who kidnapped her. I refuse.~
@1328 = ~A fine idea, Kiara.~
@1329 = ~Don't you want to save your sister, <CHARNAME>? And do you not need a fairly large amount of coins to save her?~
@1330 = ~She can wait here a bit longer and we can have a fair reward for our efforts.~
@1331 = ~There are more honorable ways of earning gold.~
@1332 = ~Very well, Kiara. Let's ask for a recompense.~
@1333 = ~I disagree. We rescued the lady; she proves ungrateful as we ask for a just reward. She can't give us any so we wait for the ransom.~
@1334 = ~Had we been paid to rescue her by whoever pays the ransom, it would have been fair just as much.~
@1335 = ~No Kiara, your arguments are wrong.~
@1336 = ~But there are more honorable ways of earning gold.~
@1337 = ~A fair reasoning, Kiara. Let's ask for a recompense.~
@1338 = ~What is wrong with asking for a reward?~
@1339 = ~Nothing. You're right, let's ask for a reward.~
@1340 = ~Nothing, I guess. But it seems you want the ransom.~
@1341 = ~The lady's thanks is enough.~
@1342 = ~Preposterous! I do not. We do not know the reward's amount yet, perhaps they only asked for a mere 1000 gold.~
@1343 = ~You are mistaken, <CHARNAME>. I'd only want to see you fairly rewarded for the good actions you do.~
@1344 = ~I do not seek rewards for the good actions I perform.  My reward is intrinsic in that I know I have made a difference for the better.~
@1345 = ~The lady's thanks would seem enough to me.~
@1346 = ~Very well, let's ask for a reward.~
@1347 = ~Considering that you need a fair amount of coin, a reward for your good actions seems amiable enough.~
@1348 = ~Else we might end up in poverty and your sister aging in whatever dark jail she currently rots.~
@1349 = ~You are really being pessimistic, Kiara.~
@1350 = ~My mind is set. The lady is free to go.~
@1351 = ~Have it your way, <CHARNAME> but I shall not suffer you refusing to be paid much longer.~
@1352 = ~The dragon would prove a powerful ally against your formidable foe, Irenicus.~
@1353 = ~I know Firkraag has been taunting you and you feel hurt but siding with such a powerful dragon could prove beneficial to your quest.~
@1354 = ~I'll never side with this *great* evil!~
@1355 = ~What do you have in mind, Kiara? I do not like the idea of allying myself with such evil.~
@1356 = ~Siding with a powerful red dragon seems an excellent idea, Kiara.~
@1357 = ~If you'd care to listen, you will see that my plan is sensible enough.~
@1358 = ~No, I refuse to listen to this, Kiara.~
@1359 = ~Very well, tell me of your brilliant plan.~
@1360 = ~We could offer Firkraag the title deed he so badly wants.~
@1361 = ~Firkraag seeks to kill Garren for the title deed. Instead I propose we steal it from Garren, saving his skin, and then bargain some information with this dragon over your sister's location.~
@1362 = ~I'd rather kill this dragon than resort to your devious plan.~
@1363 = ~What makes you think he holds such information?~
@1364 = ~I doubt this dragon will ever leave Garren any peace. It is better we get rid of this evil once and for all.~
@1365 = ~What about Garren's child?~
@1366 = ~Very well then, let's try this plan of yours.~
@1367 = ~He had many informants and knew your every movement since you arrived in Athkatla, I believe he could help you find your sister.~
@1368 = ~I doubt this dragon will ever leave Garren any peace. It is better we got rid of this evil once and for all.~
@1369 = ~What about Garren's child, still at the hands of the dragon?~
@1370 = ~Firkraag said that he left Garren alone over the last few years and that it was only your arrival that brought him into this.~
@1371 = ~I doubt he will do him more harm except for the deed, and that's where we can help.~
@1372 = ~What about Garren's child, still at the hands of the dragon?~
@1373 = ~Perhaps we could convince Firkraag to add the child in the deal?~
@1374 = ~(whispering) Please <CHARNAME>, if you'd care to listen...~
@1375 = ~What is it, Kiara?~
@1376 = ~Not at this moment, Kiara~
@1377 = ~You have become a very powerful Bhaalspawn but I could help you more my darling, if you'd let me trade the eggs for a powerful ability, a martial stance known by very few in or out of my former order..~
@1378 = ~Are you insane?~
@1379 = ~What are you talking about?~
@1380 = ~You have become very powerful but I could be more useful if you'd let me trade the eggs for a powerful martial ability.~
@1381 = ~This ability gives the powers of a dragon for a short period of time to any monk, but no one ever managed to get hold of rare dragon eggs to prepare the ability.~
@1382 = ~This Demon could prepare this ability for me in exchange for the eggs.~
@1383 = ~I am asking it as a reward, <CHARNAME>.~
@1384 = ~Why should I grant you this reward?~
@1385 = ~Well, if you want it...I can't really refuse you.~
@1386 = ~For all that we have done together, my darling, and for all the good moments spent together. Let me have this ability as a gift if you truly love me.~
@1387 = ~Very well, my love, if this is what you want, nothing could please me more.~
@1388 = ~Please, Kiara, don't ask me to do this. Anything else, anything! But not this.~
@1389 = ~For all the efforts I have provided to this party, it would only seem a just reward.~
@1390 = ~No, I can not do this.~
@1391 = ~Very well then!~
@1392 = ~I insist. If you want me to remain by your side, I beg of you to grant me this power.~
@1393 = ~Very well, then.~
@1394 = ~No, I cannot even if this means ending the relationship.~
@1395 = ~After all I have done for you, I ask for one reward and you refuse to grant it to me!~
@1396 = ~I must have really fooled myself to ever believe you cared for me.  I hope you enjoy the lonely nights.~
@1397 = ~No wait, if this really how you feel then I agree...~
@1398 = ~Fine with me.~
@1399 = ~After all Zaiya and I have done for you, we ask for one reward and you refuse to grant it. We're leaving for good.~
@1400 = ~No wait, I agree...~
@1401 = ~Hold Demon, I wish for the secret of the dragon's powers...The Dragon Stance!~
@1402 = ~Why do you let that arrogant drow treat you like a four year old child? Doesn't he know you outgrew Candlekeep and became a fearsome Bhaalspawn? Let us teach the drow a lesson!~
@1403 = ~I do not wish to enter a fight with Drizzt.~
@1404 = ~This 'drow' has been quite civil to us so far. I see no reason why we should begin an argument with him.~
@1405 = ~You're right, Kiara. The bastard drow deserves to die by my hand.~
@1406 = ~Do you show your manhood only in bed, or can I see some in real life too? Show this arrogant drow you're a man or I tell you, you may well sleep in a cold bed tonight for I shall not suffer a coward's touch.~
@1407 = ~There is no honor in defeating this drow. He has been a paragon of virtue and earned the respect of many. This is not a question of showing one's manhood.~
@1408 = ~This drow has been quite civil to us. I do not see why we should enter into an argument with him.~
@1409 = ~Fine, Kiara, if this is what you wish the bastard drow shall die this instant.~
@1410 = ~I wouldn't have imagined a Bhaalspawn so fearful of a famed drow. Are you naught but a coward?~
@1411 = ~There is no honor in defeating the drow. He has been a paragon of virtue and earned the respect of many. This is not a question of showing one's manhood.~
@1412 = ~There is no cowardice. Besides this drow has been most civil to us.~
@1413 = ~No, I am not a coward, and you *are* right. Let's kill that arrogant drow and be done with it.~
@1414 = ~A civility in disguise when he imbues himself with so much arrogance. He could not even recognize you from your last encounter.~
@1415 = ~Show this drow we all deserve respect.~
@1416 = ~He has shown us enough respect, so this conversation is over, Kiara.~
@1417 = ~There is no honor in defeating the drow. He has been a model of virtue and earned the respect of many. This is not a question of showing one's manhood.~
@1418 = ~You're right. Let us teach this drow some good manners.~
@1419 = ~And of course because of his fame you would rightly let him insult you. If Drizzt is your friend, why don't you go and give a handshake or even better, a hug!~
@1420 = ~Right. I might just do that!~
@1421 = ~He is not precisely my friend, but I still wish him no harm, Kiara.~
@1422 = ~Right, Kiara. I shall hug him with my sword in his belly.~
@1423 = ~If you let the drow get away with this, your reputation will undoubtedly be slandered and smeared. Once again I am merely pointing out your best interest.~
@1424 = ~Your concerns are baseless and I will not listen further to you, Kiara.~
@1425 = ~Consider me duly warned.~
@1426 = ~Showing signs of weakness when we are in dire needs is detrimental to our cause, <CHARNAME>. I hope this is a mere blunder.~
@1427 = ~There is nothing to be concerned about. I'm fine.~
@1428 = ~I felt my head pounding for a second, but it is gone.~
@1429 = ~This is reassuring. Let's hope it won't happen again...~
@1430 = ~This is most alarming. Let's try and get out of this place as soon as possible. A bit of fresh air certainly will improve your health.~
@1431 = ~What happened to you? You must have changed into your father's physical form, the Lord Of Murder... Fascinating.~
@1432 = ~Your body is swelling and reddening, <CHARNAME>...~
@1433 = ~Flee, flee now!! I cannot control myself.~
@1434 = ~I fear this nightmare will never end.~
@1435 = ~We have to find out what's happening to you before you get us all killed.~
@1436 = ~If we killed him, then where is your soul?~
@1437 = ~I know where my interest lies, Bhaalspawn, and do not need to be reminded every minute.~
@1438 = ~We shall get your soul back...At least I owe you that much.~
@1439 = ~I owe you that much, <CHARNAME>. But even if I did not, I wouldn't let you face Irenicus alone.~
@1440 = ~Besides, I have not many choices, have I?~
@1441 = ~The mage is quite resilient and obstinate, but he can't just live forever, can he?~
@1442 = ~I knew hell awaited me someday but...I never expected it to happen so soon.~
@1443 = ~I will not tolerate such insults, <CHARNAME>.~
@1444 = ~Very well <CHARNAME>, enjoy the pleasures of drow females if this is your attraction.~
@1445 = ~So, where was I?~
@1446 = ~You wanted to talk about your encounter with Zaiya.~
@1447 = ~I'll not let you hurt him.~
@1448 = ~(Kiara clenches her hand tightly, thrusting a fist into the air.) And you will find my fist an equal match to your sword.~
@1449 = ~Jan, stop running like a chicken! I was teasing you! Where is your sense of humor?~
@1450 = ~Boooooooooooo......Boooooooooo.......~ [MxKiaraB]
@1451 = ~Hold Rasheman, I was merely trying to help you get Boo back.~
@1452 = ~Viconia, I have never encountered an elf such as yourself. Your dark skin, silver-white hair and fierce demeanor force my admiration for your kind. Would you tell me more about the drow?~ [MxKiaraB]
@1453 = ~There is much to be desired in social skills of the drow. No wonder Viconia, you had to prostitute yourself to survive on the surface. This might be the only skill you ever really mastered.~
@1454 = ~I find it appalling that a women of noble birth would give so much interest to the paupers of this city.~ [MxKiaraB]
@1455 = ~I will gladly oblige you, Miss Nalia.~
@1456 = ~Jaheira, I have much interest in the druids and their relationship to nature, having spent some time myself in the wild. I wonder if you could enlighten me on this balance of yours?~ [MxKiaraB]
@1457 = ~Very well, the time may seem inauspicious but beware! I shall not leave the score unsettled forever.~
@1458 = ~Yoshimo, why don't you tell <CHARNAME> about Amaralis?~ [MxKiaraB]
@1459 = ~Do you always purposely make so many enemies or does it come as a natural ability such as the laying of traps, one wonders.~
@1460 = ~Finally, I get to meet my sister-in-law to be!~ [MxKiaraB]
@1461 = ~Quite an interesting aspect of him. He might even grow into a big evil one day.~
@1462 = ~Your valor and courage are not to be disputed, especially when your size puts you at great disadvantage over the brute.~ [MxKiaraB]
@1463 = ~Leave me be, Mazzy.~
@1464 = ~I do wish you luck with Gorf though.~
@1465 = ~No! You don't have a choice. Come, let's fight.~
@1466 = ~Die Bhaalspawn!~
@1467 = ~This hiding place will work for me no further.  I must leave.  If you change your mind, you may find me through my servant at my home in Athkatla.  Fare you well until then.~
@1468 = ~The hunt for Valygar Corthala.

I have met Valygar Corthala in his cabin in the Umar Hills, hiding away from the Cowled Wizards who are hunting him.  According to Valygar, he is related to Lavok, an ancient necromancer who built the sphere five hundred years before...a sphere that disappeared shortly after it was completed and has just re-appeared.  The Cowled Wizards seem sure that Valygar is the key to accessing the place, the reason for their harassment of him.

I have let Valygar go his own way, but he cannot stay any longer at the cabin now that it has been compromised.  He told me that if I should have need of him in the future, I can find him through his servant at his home in the Docks District in Athkatla.~
@1469 = ~(You look down to the ground, gathering your thoughts before the inevitable.)~
@1470 = ~Are you talkin' about the one I carry in me pants?~
@1471 = ~Yes, Korgan.~
@1472 = ~As big as the shaft of me bloody axe, if ye wan' to know. Tis' how I acquired me reputation amongst the women of me clan!~
@1473 = ~Most impressive indeed. How unfortunate that your accounts can not be verified.~
@1474 = ~I wouldn' mind letting ye play with it, girlie, if tis' what ye want! ~
@1475 = ~Kiara, why are you calling Boo?~
@1476 = ~I am not calling him per say, I'm calling your hamster's ghost.~
@1477 = ~You mean woman! You are frightening him.~
@1478 = ~I already know Boo is but a chicken.~
@1479 = ~I shall kick your evil butt for making fun of my poor Boo.~
@1480 = ~Wash your mouth after filling it with foul words. You forsake every drow expectation of female behavior. Yours is no less appalling than that of our lowly males crawling on their bellies. ~
@1481 = ~How unfortunate. I overheard your conversation with <CHARNAME> and your story on how you bestowed your skilful erotic arts on these merchants..~
@1482 = ~Such impudence from a harlot is barely conceivable! I merely sought my own interest whilst your nature is that of a slut. Poor slave girl, that you can't tell a piece of rag from the finest silk.~
@1483 = ~I never had to sleep with any men to obtain his favors. You are filled with so much arrogance, Viconia, that it blurs your own judgment. I wonder who <CHARNAME> would prefer?~
@1484 = ~Such blatant lies would deserve the whip in my home world, a punishment you would well deserve.~
@1485 = ~Who would help them if not somebody with a heart, some wealth of her own and influent friends amongst the members of the council of six?.~
@1486 = ~It would be far more simple to enslave all the poor and have them work the lands around Amn. At least, this nation would grow richer instead of unnecessarily wasting money on beggars.~
@1487 = ~Slavery is an abject notion which I strongly oppose. The vulnerable falling under the tyranny of individuals is no option for the citizenry of Amn. Your ideas are an extravagance of your own past and a condition that troubles me.~
@1488 = ~I have never been really subjected to slavery. A misfortune at sea led me to fall prey to slavers, but I do not condemn such practices. Besides, my ideas are no less extravagant than your aristocratic eccentricities.~
@1489 = ~Our worlds are too far apart. Let's not argue indefinitely and put an end to this conversation.~
@1490 = ~Why would a harlot take a sudden interest in nature? Isn't your environment of choice a city's pavement?~
@1491 = ~I've had enough Jaheira! Your allusions to my own past are truly deplorable. No wonder your man got himself killed with such a lousy mouth at his side.~
@1492 = ~How dare you judge me, harlot?~
@1493 = ~It is my own right to express myself, whether you like it or not. I shall not let you humiliate me further! Let us settle this physically!~
@1494 = ~I will not fight you. I shall not bring more trouble to <CHARNAME> than necessary.~
@1495 = ~What are you talking about, pretty one?~
@1496 = ~That you have known Amaralis for a long time. Wasn't he your best friend at a certain time?~
@1497 = ~All right, so much is true. But I hadn't seen him for a long time and did not know we were to confront him.~
@1498 = ~So why don't tell us what you know?.~
@1499 = ~A handsome young lad when I met him, with flashing black eyes like those of a predator. I was envious of how most young women became flustered in his presence. Apparently, little has changed.~
@1500 = ~We all know what he looks like, I foremost. I thought about information relevant to any future confrontation.~
@1501 = ~I haven't seen him for the last ten years and never suspected he would become so powerful. Besides, we separated on inimical terms to say the least.~
@1502 = ~It is indeed but I could still show you a few wizard tricks in the privacy of my chambers.~
@1503 = ~Such as...~
@1504 = ~I would not want to spoil such delicious surprise. Let's say it is big enough to startle those lovely eyes of yours.~
@1505 = ~I can guess from the bulge in front of your robe, Edwin, the nature of your surprise.~
@1506 = ~Oh really... Then why don't we make an appointment this evening, after midnight? My chambers...perhaps yours?~
@1507 = ~Such cheap insults are no surprise, coming from a harlot.~
@1508 = ~What a delightful nickname, but tell me is the dirt just under your fingernails or in your mouth too, ranger?~
@1509 = ~I shall not tolerate this further.~
@1510 = ~I was merely testing your patience, ranger, and I am forced to notice that you run out of it fairly quickly.~
@1511 = ~If you were a man and had the balls that comes with being such, you'd have long ago tasted the sharpness of my blade. My advice for now is stay away from me.~
@1512 = ~What?~
@1513 = ~Oh I know, so much happened since you were kidnapped by the Cowled wizards. My name is Kiara, but you might as well call me Kiki since we are soon to be *sisters*.~
@1514 = ~No, this can not be...He would have never chosen such an evil... What have you done to him?~
@1515 = ~I was just teasing you. I am merely his companion and do not entertain any marriage plan. I feel such bonds are unnecessary between us.~
@1516 = ~Whoa, I've never been so scared in my life but I'm glad to hear he hasn't completely lost his wits.~
@1517 = ~Sorry if I did scare you, but tell me Imoen, a bit of girl chit-chat, how was your brother when he was younger?~
@1518 = ~A little devil, always playing pranks on others. Fortunately for him, Gorion was always quick to forgive. I must tell you of the day he sneaked into Candlekeep's library and made fun out of Ulraunt.~
@1519 = ~Ulraunt, the head of Candlekeep, and Tethtoril, the first reader, were both absorbed in some books. <CHARNAME> and I were hiding under one of the tables with a chicken.~
@1520 = ~When Tethtoril left, we placed the chicken on his chair. Ulraunt was still absorbed in his book and didn't notice our little sratagem.~
@1521 = ~This is when <CHARNAME> called "Ulraunt! cukledoo Ulraunt cuckledoo please help me...cuckledoo I read this book when cuckledoo I've changed into a cuckledoo..."~
@1522 = ~Ulraunt really thought Tethtoril had been changed into a chicken and tried all kind of spells and incantations. 'Twas so very funny.~
@1523 = ~If you keep an eye on me as you did on your wife, then I won't have much to fear.~
@1524 = ~How dare you speak of my wife? Such impudence.~
@1525 = ~I did not provoke you, and your remark hurt me as much as mine did you. We are fairly even, Keldorn. Besides I do not look forward to fight an old man, so close to retirement. You should have stayed home with your wife and children.~
@1526 = ~This old man has enough experience to teach you some lessons in life and some good manners as well, young lady.~
@1527 = ~You know my death would mean that of Zaiya too, when she hasn't provoked you in the least and has a morality somewhat close to your own, do you not? I am sure you do not look forward to add the title of slayer of women to that of knight.~
@1528 = ~I would not be so arrogant, Kiara, as if you were to prove a threat, the hand holding this sword shall not hesitate even an instant to end your life.~
@1529 = ~Are you trying to mock me, Kiara?~
@1530 = ~(*evil grin*) No, a few words of encouragement or, perhaps, your epitaph before you face a foolish death.~
@1531 = ~Keep the epitaph for yourself. Arvoreen will grant me victory over this Gorf and perhaps some strength leftover to allow me to teach you a lesson next.~
@1532 = ~I look forward to it, though I am wondering what size would be appropriate for your coffin...A matchbox could be just right if Gorf squeezes you a bit.~
@1533 = ~Make fun all you wish. Let's see how you laugh when time is ripe for you to face your own death.~
@1534 = ~My own fate is sealed in solid rock. I have no fear when it comes to what lies ahead.~
@1535 = ~That explains much about your disdain for others and your constant mockery. I wish we could help you. The kindness you have shown towards poor Zaiya tells me that within lies a good person, some remnants of your past love.~
@1536 = ~...I am not a singer, I am an actor.~
@1537 = ~I see... So how long have you been impersonating a bard?~
@1538 = ~But I am one! I know enough battle songs to instill courage in your soul and fear to our enemies. ~
@1539 = ~One who can not sing love songs can not truly call himself a bard, at most you are a thief. One who apparently would also fail poorly at stealing a woman's heart.~
@1540 = ~Is your tongue always as sharp as the sting of the bee, my raven?~
@1541 = ~I was teasing you. Fear me not, poet, as I am quite fond of your kind.~
@1542 = ~You have shown only disdain and hatred for those traveling with you. Why should I expect any favor?~
@1543 = ~Don't expect any. It seems you are indifferent to a woman's charms. Has this anything to do with your origins? ~
@1544 = ~To woman's charms I am hardly indifferent, but your heart is full of hatred and fails to inspire me.~
@1545 = ~What do you mean, Kiara? I am content with the path I have chosen and would have none different.~
@1546 = ~Your loathing for your father brought you to seek refuge with the paladins. Though, there are other ways you could have chosen to spend the rest of your life.~
@1547 = ~You were yourself raised in a monastery and from the accounts I have overheard, quite at peace.~
@1548 = ~It was at such a young age that I could have hardly made any other decision, but you have as of late chosen to flee from your father's house and join The Order. I fail to understand why the paladins in particular and not the temple of some god such as Lathander or Helm.~
@1549 = ~I wished to serve a noble cause but through action, not devotion. I sought to discover the broader world and take part in famed adventures, not spend my life in a cloistered cell.~
@1550 = ~You had the courage to face hordes of orcs through Omnlur hills, but you could never face the one beast that haunts you day and night: your father. Why did you not face him and spit out your anger? You would have found at peace with yourself by now had you done so.~
@1551 = ~A confrontation with a stubborn drunkard would have been fruitless. ~
@1552 = ~Kiki? I urge you to keep your distance, gnome! This familiarity is as distasteful as the allusion to your cousin Bertha and her hands.~
@1553 = ~Oh no! I was not making any allusions to you... Her hands were much bigger than yours, almost bigger than her feet. The only trait you might share with her is an ill tempered manner.~
@1554 = ~(Kiara gives Jan a slap on his head.)~
@1555 = ~Ouch! Now what did you go and do that for?~
@1556 = ~So you can be sure I'll not hesitate to beat you like your cousin Bertha. Here take that bag...and cover your head!~
@1557 = ~What?~
@1558 = ~You heard me gnome, I've *seen* enough of you today.~
@1559 = ~Kiara, surely we can not... This is wrong!~
@1560 = ~He does not care much for you either and signed your death too. At least let's try to die with honor...on the battlefield.~
@1561 = ~But <CHARNAME> has done so much for us!~
@1562 = ~Only to let us both down when it seemed so convenient. Listen Zaiya, it is a desperate fight, but would you rather suffer the tortures of your curse or die by the Bhaalspawn's hand?~
@1563 = ~There are no choices left, it seems...~
@1564 = ~Your past had much sorrow, but the future may bring even more. You should be careful not to corrupt the one Bhaalspawn.~
@1565 = ~Your deal with the demon is a foul one and is likely to leave you hurt.~
@1566 = ~(Kiara has been deceptive but since the deal was made she has proven blameless. She somehow feels uneasy before your gaze and tries to give you a smile.)~
@1567 = ~Kiara, your fate is sealed to mine, but let us at least face death with dignity.~
@1568 = ~Kiara, at least redeem your treachery by putting up a good fight.~
@1569 = ~(There is nothing more to be said.  Without a further word, you turn grimly back to the stairs before you.  Your soul awaits.)~
@1570 = ~(You raise your eyes only to find Kiara looking at you with a worried expression on her face. Memories of the recent events suddenly surface. The deal with a Demon Lord put you at unease. She notices your awkward hesitation and decides to speak first.)~
@1571 = ~(You raise your eyes only to find Kiara looking at you with a worried expression on her face. The recent events have left scars that have barely started to heal. She notices your awkward hesitation, and decides to speak first.)~
@1572 = ~You have much to hide, Kiara, and I'll be keeping a watchful eye on your actions. I fear I do not trust you.~ [MxKiaraB]
@1573 = ~Kiki, you remind me of my cousin Bertha, who happened to have huge hands but was mostly known for beating her husband from time to time. The poor man felt so humiliated he used to wear a bag over his head when he went to the market for fear of being recognized... ~ [MxKiaraB]
@1574 = ~<CHARNAME>...heeeelp!~
@1575 = ~We should have gagged the women a long time ago. Not to mention installed a chastity belt on the wench to protect the men around us.~
@1576 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'll not tolerate a harlot in our party much longer. Ask her to keep silent. She's piercing my sensitivity with her pathetic stories.~
@1577 = ~You never had any sensitivity, Viconia, so let Kiara talk.~
@1578 = ~This is not the underdark and you shall not dictate your own terms, drow.~
@1579 = ~I have no intentions on going anywhere with the girl, Viconia, I'm just having fun.~
@1580 = ~Rest assured, Viconia, I have no desire for her.~
@1581 = ~Your taste for harlots is pathetic and weak. I'll not associate with you further, rivvin.~
@1582 = ~My companion, Kiara.~
@1583 = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@1584 = ~Take poor Kiara here. I understand you have developed a relationship of sorts. It's so hard on couples when something happens to one of them, don't you agree? ~
@1585 = ~Ahh, but I do not speak for him, Kiara. I speak of you. This is a lesson, <CHARNAME>. Follow me and you will lose more than you could imagine. Starting now!~
@1586 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Kiara.  Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@1587 = ~You have taken too much already!  You will return both Imoen's soul and Kiara!~
@1588 = ~And you have delivered on that promise. Return Kiara and perhaps I will be merciful.~
@1589 = ~I would have hunted you for your theft of Kiara alone.  She is very important to me.~
@1590 = ~You place too much confidence in sentiment.  The theft of Kiara will not save you.~
@1591 = ~She is lost to you, <CHARNAME>. Kiara has been quite receptive to my wiles. I doubt your fumbling could have inspired the loyalty I have taken with a bite and a gaze. ~
@1592 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi has turned Kiara into a vampire!  Or... or very nearly.  The process may not have been completed in the short time Bodhi has had her.  Hopefully something can be done or I will have lost her.  Perhaps the elven war sage might know some way of restoration... or Elhan... ~
@1593 = ~My life and Kiara are one!~
@1594 = ~I was born in a village near Medina al Afyal. I loved to learn and study but my parents were extremely poor and I could have never risen above my status as the island is governed by very strict social codes.~
@1595 = ~My father one day went to seek help from a powerful elemental mage, a man named Korezam, who specialized in all kind of poisonous spells. All our animals had fallen sick and my father was hoping the mage would provide him with a remedy.~
@1596 = ~Korezam offered my father a cure to the plague if he could provide him with a servant. The mage was getting old and would need somebody to help him in his studies. My father immediately proposed I become his helper.~
@1597 = ~I was quite happy to live with Korezam but was never really happy about the progress of my magic. Although he had defended the reading of his collection books against wild magic, I started studying them in secret at a later age.~
@1598 = ~One day, something awful happened. I was reading a book on powerful poisons and their effects when a wild surge occurred. I was cursed. Korezam tried several remove curse spells, but it was to no avail. He was getting old and was not able to move much from home and told me to go to Medina al Afyal and seek help in the temples, perhaps the potions would help or some genie.~
@1599 = ~I visited nearly all the temples in Medina and used several potions prepared by skilful herbalists, but none of them worked and my condition worsened.~
@1600 = ~Fortunately, I met Kiara in one of these temples, and she said she might be able to assist.~
@1601 = ~Kiara has powerful healing hands and she is able to stabilize my condition from time to time by applying her hands over my body...It does not remove the curse but helps me live. Ever since, I stayed with her as her servant.~
// KIARA - CERND BY BRI
@1650 = ~Cernd, I must ask you about your intentions toward...Zaiya...~ [MxKiaraB] //kiara
@1651 = ~What? Why? Has something gone amiss?~ //cernd
@1652 = ~You tell me druid. I sense that you are infatuated with her, but I don't know whether I should allow you to continue to stand in her presence.~//KIA 
@1653 = ~No matter what else may happen, she is my ward, and as such, is under my protection. It remains to be seen whether I will suffer your presence around her or not~ //KIA
@1654 = ~And what do you propose to do? As Zaiya has pointed out to me, the smallest thought, the tiniest emotion, may grow, flourish, and blossom under even the most extreme circumstances. She is a fine woman, and fit to make her decisions...~ //CERMD
@1655 = ~And she is still bound by her illness, lest you forget, druid, and any...emotional...disruption may cause her further harm. Consider this a warning, Cernd...tread lightly where Zaiya is concerned, or even MAINCHARA will save you from my wrath.~ //KIARA
@1656 = ~I find your concern unnecessary, Kiara. Why, I thought the training of the monasteries included acceptance of the world as it is...and to transcend its boundaries.~ //CERND
@1657 = ~I abandoned that portion of my life long ago, Cernd. Just remember, until a cure is discovered for Zaiya, I am the totality of her world...and you may be part of hers as well.~ //KIA 
@1658 = ~However, the world changes. A broken mirror never reflects again; fallen flowers never go back to the old branches...~ //KIA

@2002 = ~Don't worry, I am not offended. I understand your sacrifice was for the benefit of us all.~
@2003 = ~Having a little fling with the drow? Perhaps his exoticness appeals to you or you do not like women after all?~
@2004 = ~You are mistaken, Kiara. I am simply holding his hand as a sign of friendship, nothing more I assure you.~
@2005 = ~Why do you ask?~
@2006 = ~Well perhaps I do prefer him after all.~
@2007 = ~Then at least have the decency to leave his hand alone and take mine. Else, you may find a cold bed very soon.~
@2008 = ~Yes, Kiara.~
@2009 = ~Kiara, I shall not let you give me any orders nor shall I let you choose my friends, for that matter.~
@2010 = ~Have I not a right to ask after having shared your bed? So, tell me what are your intentions towards the drow?~
@2011 = ~I shall do as I please, Kiara!~
@2012 = ~Nothing. We are just friends.~
@2013 = ~So, one exotic creature after another, is it? What are you going to fall for next? Let me guess, perhaps a siren fallen on one of Amn's shores or one of these tree nymphs whilst wandering in the woods.~
@2014 = ~Get out of my sight. You sicken me.~
@2015 = ~How could you let Zaiya die?! Is this what *I* am supposed to expect too? You sicken me. I'll not stay with you a minute longer.~
@2016 = ~<CHARNAME>! I have something of great importance to tell you.~
@2017 = ~Very well, I'm all ears.~
@2018 = ~Has it something to do with the fact that I am now evil?~
@2019 = ~A long time ago, I was in love with a young monk named Osan. One night we were caught in the act by the head of our monastic order. That night, Osan died from the punishment and I was expelled from the monastery.~

@2021 = ~HE asked me for a favor and my soul against the promise of satisfying my desire for revenge.~
@2022 = ~I was young and naive and accepted his foul deal.~
@2023 = ~What kind of favor did you consent to?~
@2024 = ~He asked me to corrupt a Bhaalspawn, turn his soul to the forces of evil...~
@2025 = ~It seems you have failed. So, what now?~
@2026 = ~And you have failed. I hope your punishment will match your treachery!~
@2027 = ~And it seems you have succeeded. Your treachery deserves death.~
@2028 = ~So, you were but a tool!~
@2029 = ~My fate is sealed and my retribution is death, but HE might as well tell you himself...HE is on his way from the abyss.~
@2030 = ~Your betrayal certainly deserves death.~

@2041 = ~What are you talking about, Kiara?~
@2042 = ~And why should I?~
@2043 = ~I am talking about the fact that on several occasions I offered my advice but it was disregarded, and I am sick of it!~
@2044 = ~Get out of my sight! Your sense of loyalty, your bravery and moral values sicken me.~
@2045 = ~I must apologize to you...~
@2046 = ~Very well, let's hear it.~
@2047 = ~Selfish and self-centered as you are, I really don't see the point.~

//LOVESCENES KIARA -- Not proofed, til I get Bri's versions. -Jess
@9000 =~Kiara's kisses feel almost desperate as you make your way to your room, her welcoming lips fluttering beneath yours like wounded doves. Her soft mouth forms a perfect seal around yours, her every breath merging with yours. She becomes lost in your kisses, clinging to you like a drowning woman would cling to a bit of driftwood. You find yourself no less adrift in her embrace, drowning together in the sea of shared passion. The taste of eagerness on your beloved's lips is sweet, anticipation quivering in every touch of mouth to mouth. Kiara's hands entwine her fingers with yours, the warmth of her passion ardently matching the flames of desire burning deep within you. The rising purr in the back of her throat reverberates against yours, matching the growing moan that quickly escapes your attempts to suppress it. The moment seems to last a lifetime, and yet is over all too quickly, the pressure of needing to breathe finally separating the two of you. 

Kiara smiles up at you, a hint of shyness present in her luminescent eyes, then brushes back a loose strand of silken hair from her face, the fiery tendril smelling of the earth, of exotic hyacinth, of young clover. As she leans back against the door to your room, her normally graceful hands suddenly fumbling as they attempt to turn the knob, Kiara leans against you to steal one more kiss, melding her sinuous body against yours. She pulls you closer, teasing your tongue with her own, inviting you wordlessly to deepen the exquisite kiss, to explore her mouth and learn every bit of it, to search out the very depths of her soul. Alas, such poignant moments cannot last forever, and the kiss breaks as Kiara successfully opens the door. Her backward momentum pulls her away from you and breaks the mesmerizing dream you briefly shared. Kiara lowers her eyelashes, her full, luscious lips trembling slightly.

Slowly, she opens her eyes, finding your gaze locked upon her. As gentle as a feather, she takes your hand in her smaller one and raises it to her face, caressing her petal-soft cheek with the back of your hand. A wonderful shiver passes through her body, her every languid motion a silent moan of desire. You pull her closer again, enfolding her in your embrace, once more covering her sensuous mouth with yours. This kiss, though it doesn't last as long, is just as intense, flushing Kiara's cheeks with rosy warmth. You can almost taste her yearning; her desire to be one with you is sweeter than honey. As you move forward yet again, seeking her lips, Kiara puts a hand to your chest, her eyes pleading with you to stop a moment.

Gently, Kiara raises your right hand to her lips, her questing tongue tasting the salty residue of sweat on your skin, then gives you a few tender nips which cause tiny surges of pain to flood through your body, quickly followed by waves of relief. She brings your longest finger to her lips, first nibbling the tip daintily, then sucking the whole of the digit into her mouth. The wash of feelings flooding your soul as she runs her tongue around that finger ignites a fire deep inside you. Closing your eyes, you let your body revel in the sensations that her warm mouth produces. Just before your body screams for release from the sweet torment, Kiara plants a gentle kiss gingerly in the palm of your hand, wisps of her long hair tickling your pleasure-sated skin.

Kiara moves her focus to your neck, her teeth softly pulling at the tender flesh, her hot breath breezing through your hair as she continues ever downward. When her full lips cross the neckline of your shirt, Kiara ever so slowly pulls it open, wanting nothing more than to feel her soft cheek against the solid, muscled flesh of your chest, and to listen to your heart beat. As the passion burns ever hotter within you, you sense Kiara's need as great as your own, and pull her back up. You press your questing lips firmly onto her gently teasing ones, demanding entrance to the warm cavern of her mouth.

You slide your fingers up the back of Kiara's neck, tangling them in the mass of hair at her nape, your grasp gently pulling her head back. Your lips and tongue wander from her mouth to her throat, showering her with warm kisses. A deep moan escapes Kiara, the very vibration of it tickling the tip of your tongue as you trail it across her beautiful neck. You begin to loosen her robe, exposing the satin skin underneath. Pulling back, you pause to admire the magnificence of her body revealed in the dim light, as lithe and supple as a panther, with all of the understated strength and grace of that creature. The passion you've ignited brings a certain tautness to every well-defined muscle. 

You lower your head to the irresistible swell of her breast, trailing kisses along its turgid fullness. A tremor shakes Kiara's body, and her hand rises to the back of your head, seemingly of its own accord, pushing your closer to her young, firm flesh. Her breath quickens, each inhalation pressing her breast forward into your eager mouth. Kiara pulls back from you ever so slightly to lie down on the bed, using your shirt to pull you down atop her and pinning your strong arms against her soft, yielding body. You read her every thought, anticipating her need, and allow her to tug the offending shirt away as she runs her nimble fingers up your arms. This simplest of touches sends flames of desires shooting through your body and causes your manhood to swell with the need of her.

As you look into Kiara's eyes, she averts her gaze slightly, her hands gently nudging your head towards her lovely bare breasts. Kiara preens, arching her back, as your eyes drink in the beauty before them. An adorable mewling noise slips from her throat. "Please," she whispers. Obedient to her wishes, you cover each creamy breast with kisses. Kiara's heartbeat throbs beneath your wandering lips, her flesh heaving with each of her rasping, shallow gasp. "Slower.." she breathes, her voice barely audible even to your attentive ears.

You are ever responsive to your lover's desires, running your fingers along the length of her arm and feeling the building hear beneath your callused fingertips. You slide one arm beneath hers, capturing her nearness and softly whisper her name. "Kiara...my Kiara.." Slowly your mouth makes its way towards her stiffened nipple, and you begin circling it with your tongue, teasing and caressing her flesh with your lips. The rippling shivers coursing through Kiara's body causes her breasts to jiggle pleasantly against your face.

When you lift your mouth from her bosom, Kiara positions herself on top of you, massaging your skin with her breasts, alternately tickling you and inundating you with waves of pleasure and desire. Kiara shudders as you rise up to meet her, covering her neck and chest with your warm, wet tongue once again, taking your time to cover every inch of her full, creamy breasts. Feeling your firm body pressing against her, Kiara murmurs her need for you, begging you with eyes and soul for your touch. The simple words and eloquent silences act like air to a smoldering fire, fanning the flames of desire to a roaring blaze burning throughout your body. Freeing some of the raging passion, you take her face in your hands and pull Kiara's mouth to yours, devouring her lips and drawing her tongue deep into your mouth, suckling it lightly.

As you release Kiara's mouth, you roll again, placing her on her back. Kiara opens her legs to you, allowing your body to fit with hers. As she does, you steal the opportunity to run your fingers along one silky thigh and caress her hip. Your every touch causes her to thrust upwards to meet you, moans of pleasure and deepest desire taking shape under your masterful caresses. Gently you rise from her embrace, and through her half-lidded eyes, Kiara watches you stand before her as you allow your trousers to drop to the floor. Your proud manhood stands to attention, evidence of your strong need and desire, though Kiara doesn't seem afraid of its prodigious size. She seems to sense that you'll not take your pleasure just yet, despite the obvious passion burning in your loins.

Naked now, you reach down to take Kiara again into your arms, kissing her not softly, but instead giving her a kiss aflame with the fires of passionate desire. You feel your heart beating in unison with hers, your very soul melting into her own. Kiara tenderly runs her feet up the back of your calves, her motion stirring the air and tickling the hair on your legs. Her small hands massage the tight muscles of your back and shoulders, working at the tension in your taut body. Almost lazily, your hands explore her full, rounded breasts, then lower to her stomach, caressing her skin, kneading it, feeling her body undulate beneath your every touch. A moan of pleasure rises from deep in Kiara's throat as your fingers trace a trail from the curve of her hip to her inner thigh, inching your way towards her sweet, smooth mound. As your fingers wander ever closer to the centre of her pleasure, a sudden thrill of desire causes Kiara to shriek, her legs tightening around you, every bit of her luscious body begging for more of your intimate touches.

Seeing how totally Kiara's body responds and feeling the wetness engulfing your hand drives you nearly to the brink of passion, but with some difficulty, you restrain your inclination to seek your ultimate fulfillment. You press your lips to the juncture of Kiara's legs, alternating kissing and breathing warm air over the sensitive nodule, caressing her with your tongue and mouth. Suddenly, Kiara's body begins to shake, her legs stiffening and locking around you tightly. Her back arches like a cat in heat, sending her beautiful breasts jutting high into the air. Her cries of pleasure are sweeter than any music you can ever remember. 

You slide your body up the length of Kiara's then, fitting yourself between her open legs. You plunge your tongue deep into her mouth, your body feeling completely aflame with the heat of passion, demanding its own satiation. As your tongue finds its desired destination in the honeyed sweetness of her mouth, your rigid, swollen manhood finds the welcoming warmth of her as you bury yourself deep within her in one intense motion, pressing swiftly through the barrier obstructing your entrance to her. Kiara cries out, notes of pleasure and pain mingled in her passionate tones, drowning in the bittersweet agony of her desire. Pleasure quickly wins out over the initial surge of pain, and Kiara's hips thrust up to meet yours, your bodies settling into a blissful rhythm, each giving and taking from the other. Kiara starts to vibrate once more, a high crooning gasp escaping her as she digs her nails into your back, scoring your skin and pulling you down to feel your hard chest pressed against the soft, giving warmth of her breasts. The intensity of her reaction sends your body over the edge, and you feel suddenly as if you were falling -- no, flying, entwined with your lover in passion's sweet oblivion. Kiara pulls you tight a final time, shuddering as you fill her with your seed. As you lay your head on her shoulder, both panting with the exertion, Kiara strokes the side of your face, whispering tenderly "I love you..."~


@9001 = ~Kiara leads you by the hand into the bedroom up the narrow stairs. She stops outside the door frame, the overhead light silhouetting her lithe, taut body, the muscles rippling from years of training as a monk. Her crimson hair wreathes her face like an incarnadine crown, and it briefly tickles your face, carrying a hint of jasmine into your nostrils. Kiara leans in and forces her lips to yours, the kiss lasting until your lungs burn in yearning for more oxygen. She pulls back, a wicked smile on her salty red lips, and she motions you into the room. As you shuffle forward, she gives your backside a teasing slap, sending a sharp sting through your body.

Once inside, Kiara strides before you, slowly taking off her robe, revealing her tanned body, her light scars gleaming in the moonlight, contrasting with her browned skin. You notice her inviting breasts, begging to be caressed, but Kiara presses her hand to your chest, making you stop. She walks around you, slowly removing your clothes, grazing your body with the lightest of touches, her fingertips tracing the definition of your muscles. Kiara goes behind you and ties your hands together with a black scarf; the silky fabric smooth against your skin. She takes another scarf and ties it around your eyes; now you're in abject darkness. You sense Kiara standing in front of you then she is gone. As you blindly look for her, you feel a slight breeze tickle the finest of your hairs the air moving in a circular fashion. The swirl of air stops, and the only thing you can hear is the sound of both yours and Kiara's breath. Then you feel her light lips kiss your neck, causing you to shiver in anticipation. You feel Kiara's moist breath in your ear, telling you not to move. Suddenly, you are left alone; your ears strain trying to hear her in the other parts of the room...

You barely hear Kiara's light footfalls, her monk training allowing her to move as quiet as a cat. You feel apprehensive and then jump as Kiara softly touches your shoulder.. She chuckles as you feel her warm breath on the back of your neck. This feeling is inviting until you feel something soft, almost fragile, lazily make its way along your shoulder, causing goose bumps to rise, a slight ticklish sensation that builds and you realize Kiara has a feather in her hands.

She runs the feather slowly, softly over your shoulders and down your back. Lower and lower until she skims the top of your backside, back and forth, up and down, sending ripples of electrical pleasure up your spine. She goes further down and follows the contours of your rear, the gentle sensation driving you crazy. As you shiver with pleasure, Kiara harshly tells you to "Stay put. Do not move again."

She runs the feather over your inner thighs where the skin is extra sensitive. You shiver in response and again she chuckles. Next she runs the feather down one leg and tickles the back of your knee. You moan and try to move the knee away... *SMACK* She swats you on the backside with her open palm, sending a brief flare of pain up through your body and you put your leg back. Kiara tickles the other knee; you moan and squirm slightly. Kiara pulls the feather down to one ankle and tickles the top of your feet, causing you to waver on your feet as the pleasure conflicts with your ability to stand. She moves the feather up and down the back of your legs as she crawls in front of you

Kiara runs the feather up one leg to the knee, and when she starts to go further up, your breath hitches in anticipation. She bypasses the area you really want her to play with and stands up. She starts again at your shoulders and neck, running the feather softly side to side across your chest, Kiara enjoying your fidgeting discomfiture, occasionally stopping for you to regain your control.. She makes it to one of your nipples and she teases it with the tip of the feather; causing the nipple to pucker up hard before doing the same to the other side.

Kiara leans forward and softly kisses one of your nipples; you shudder at the touch of her soft lips. She smiles and flicks out her tongue to lick at one nipple then the next. You moan again and she bites a nipple lightly, causing a prickle of pain, and then soothes it with her tongue. As she kisses and bites him she moves the feather further down; running it slowly down your stomach and playing around your belly button, her fine nails causing white lines to appear on your tanned skin before the blood rushes back in and .

Kiara reaches forward with the feather, stroking the inside of the thigh and touches the sensitive skin at one hip with her other and laughs at your energetic jump from her touch. .

She decides to go ahead and play nice. The feather slowly goes down and reaches the base of your groin. She teases you there for several seconds until your hips start jerking. She pulls away again, letting you calm down for several seconds. Your manhood is standing out by now and she start to slowly circle it with the feather around and around. 

"Do you want more?" she asks. You moan. She smacks one of your cheeks with her hand, hard, and then the other cheek, leaving bright red hand prints. "I asked you a question."

"Yes, I want more," the strained response comes from your lips. 

She drops the feather and her other hand rubs your buttocks. She slowly starts to kiss your stomach, leaving a wet trail with her mouth, giving slight nips with her teeth, and then stroking your manhood. Your hips strain forward as she increases the rhythm of her caresses until Kiara stops abruptly, leaving you panting fast, shallow breaths, your head thrown back in pleasure and the sensations overwhelm your darkened world. 

"Do you want to me?" she asks. 

You try to speak but nothing comes out. She sees you swallow, and a raspy "Yes" finally comes out. She smiles and licks her way up your body, stopping to nip at each nipple and ends up kissing your lips, long and languorously. 

She pulls away again and goes behind you, undoing the scarf at your wrists. Kiara rubs your wrists to get the circulation back, the sudden rush of blood sending delectable pain and pleasure in equal measure into your hands, heightened further. She reaches up, unties the blindfold and you blinks in the sudden light, black spots pulsating before your eyes when you feel a delectable pain on your shoulder, causing you to gasp. As you look, you make out Kiara's outline, bite marks left behind from her kissable lips.

She walks in front of you and when you take a step towards her, she says, "Stop," and you come to a halt.

Kiara walks over to the bed and lies down on the mound of pillows. Her hands run up and down her full breasts, the nipples hard points, and she pulls and twists at them. She puts a finger in her mouth and sucks it, in and out. She then runs her finger down from her lips; leaving a wet trail down to one of her breasts; she teases the nipple a little then runs it down her stomach. She goes in and out of her belly button once, just a suggestion of what is to come. She runs the wet finger down to her mound and slowly opens her legs and spreads them wide, and she starts to caress herself, moaning all the while.

"Come here" she orders, as she puts her finger in her mouth.

You slowly walk to the bed and Kiara guides you between her legs. Her hands roughly grab you and pull you further down on the bed; she buries your head in her love nest, urging you onward. Kiara cries out and jerks her hips up to meet your tongue, her legs locking like a vice around your head, the pressure building in your forehead. 

Kiara starts to scream loudly, and each scream is punctuated by another bucking between her shudders and rasping breaths.

However, Kiara regains her self-control, and she pulls your head up by the hair, pressing her lips tightly to yours, tasting herself on you.

Kiara then grabs your hardness into her and thrust herself onto you. She moans, grabs your hips with her iron-strong legs, and pulls you deep toward her. As she starts to buck, she urges you to increase the tempo. Kiara cries out with each thrust, her breath starts to come in quick rushes. As she senses your incipient eruption, she presses her lips firmly to yours, and sucks your very breath away, then biting the edges of your lips, allowing the blood to flow in your mutual kiss, her nails raking your very back, and you feel a cool chill run up your spine as a faint breeze in the room crosses your back.

However, the moment finally comes, and you explode between pleasure and pain in Kiara's embrace, when you both fall to the bed, sharing a last ragged breath. Kiara gives a smile in your direction, then pushes you off of her, rolling you to the other side of the bed, before draping herself across your bronzed chest, her eyes half-lidded, murmuring pleasantly, "Mine..."~

@9002 = ~Kiara looks ravishing, standing there at the top of the stairs. Her vibrant red hair flows in waterfall-like tendrils over her shoulders and down to her partially covered, full breasts, her robe haphazardly drawn across her body. Her skin resembles something akin to alabaster with a blush that was present just beneath it and her eyes glow with an eerie, emerald likeness. At this hour, though, you are amazed that they are even glowing at all. You step back, in the shadow of the banister, and wait to see what Kiara's next step will be. You see that she is breathing heavily, her heaving bosom raising upwards and just as quickly, lowering to its normal level. She has a fine sprinkling of perspiration over her brow, while you can smell dampness arising from her hair along with a faint lilac scent, evidence she just took a bath. 

You sense urgency radiating from her, as she scans the bottom floor. You feel a rise in your britches and struggle to keep your thoughts tame. How your body wanted her, how your muscular arms wanted to hold her, a growing crescendo of desire subsuming your body as your mind remembers the first time you made love. Now your brow is the one damp with sweat, a single, salty bead of perspiration rolls down your cheek. Your heart thuds against your chest as you step out from the shadows. Kiara gasps when she sees you him and takes off retreating into her room. 

You race up the stairs, chasing after her, knowing that she isn’t that far in front of you. Your eyes adjust to the darkness easily and see that the entrance is empty. Suddenly, you feel a rush of air from behind you, from the back of the opened door, and you reach out with a hand, capturing Kiara by her arm, swinging her around until she stands in front of you. Her mouth opens, and you feel the hot breath escape her, and she licks her lips, as she whispers, "Are you worthy of my attention?"

She reaches over, and starts to kiss your fingers, sliding her welcoming tongue along a digit. You almost lose yourself in passion when you feel a flare of pain, and see that Kiara has bit your hand. She smiles, as she continues, "Don't...take...me...for...granted..."

Her eyes widen, and you can see into the depths of those emerald pools. Her chest was heaves with her breathing. You step closer and fall into heaven as her firm breasts brushed against your chest. You feel her nipples harden through her clothing. Your find your restraint as Kiara's mesmerizing gaze entrances you, emptying you of all but the most basic thoughts. The single most thought in your mind is how it would feel to have her lips press on yours. You succumb to your desires and lean in.

As your lips close on hers, you hear a sound rise from the back of Kiara's throat, one of eagerness and anticipation. You feel the fight drain from her as his your lips sweep over hers, her mouth eagerly opening. Your tongue gains access to the dark corners of her mouth, her mouth still sweet from the wine imbibed earlier that evening. 

So this was how passion tastes, you think to yourself, a taste of heaven. Your hands come up Kiara's fiery hair, still moist from her bath, and you pull her head back and greedily feast on her neck. Your lips can't cover enough skin, can't devour enough of her velvet, and can’t taste enough of her. She gasps as your teeth gently nip her shoulder. Kiara trembles in your arms, her presence inciting a flare of fiery passion within you. Her arms encircle your back, fingers digging into your waistband. Kiara presses herself closer, her lips came nibbling at the corners of your mouth. The hand in her hair gently pulls her back from you so that she faces you once more.

"Never hesitate..." Kiara whispers, gazing into your face, strength showing on her features, "If I am to be yours...you are to be mine..."

She nips at you with her heart shaped mouth, and testily says, "I'd like a response from you..."

You see a grimace tug at the corners of her mouth as she awaits a reply. Your emotions flare up in a whirlwind of love and desire, and you answer her by yanking a hand free from her hair bringing it down, so that you have free access to her chest. Your other hand frees itself from her hair and nimbly opens her robe in front and enjoy the view. Creamy white breasts with sienna colored nipples, achingly hard, are almost more than you can bear to see. You draw a turgid peak into your mouth and begin to suckle. Kiara's head drops back and a soft moan escapes her mouth. Your hand opens Kiara's robe further, allowing it to slide to the ground, exposing her lithe form. As Kiara writhes under your touch, you suddenly desire to stare into the liquid jade of Kiara's eyes as you pour yourself into her. You lower her to the ground, taking off your own garment, the moonlight exposing your well-toned body, the darkness obscuring the faint scars earned in your travels. You stretch out beside her, Kiara's hands roaming over your body, touching this and fondling that, each caress sending an electric pulse moving through your body. You suck in your breath as Kiara finds your manhood and caresses, causing a fierce tremor to ripple through your body and in her hand. 

Kiara looks into your eyes, opening her mouth as if to say something, but your lips come down on hers just then, stifling whatever she was going to say. Your hand finds her, sweetly wet and swollen. She arches against your hand and feels her extremities go numb. Kiara's musky scent is carried in the night air, and her body throbs under your touch. You stroke her once, twice, and you feel Kiara shudder as waves of pleasure cascades through her. You start to stroke her again, and Kiara trembles against you, moans escaping her mouth, and soon she is arching against you, and taking shallow breaths, when you suddenly stop. Kiara's eyes flash open, a dangerous glint rising in her slitted eyes.

All of a sudden, something much softer is in place over her womanhood. Smoothing over it and gliding effortlessly into her. On her and in her. Kiara closes her eyes again, arching her head backward as your tongue swept over her core, over and over again. Kiara's legs tense, and her legs clutch at you, and a scream breaks the night’s silence as the wave of pleasure that envelops her leaves her tingly in all her extremities, her eyes glassing over, her body still tense. 

“Relax love..." you whisper to Kiara. You have her attention now. Her eyes clear, and she opens herself to you, her arms reaching behind your back to pull you down into herself. Up and down you move until Kiara lies gasping, her legs wrapping tightly around your waist. She arches her back as you increase your tempo, until you feel your own incipient insatiable build up, and you both explode with cries of pleasure.

You collapse onto Kiara, and her arms come up, surrounding you, and pulling you close. She softly caresses your cheek, kissing away the beads of sweat, and whispers, "I love you..."~

@3011 = ~The person who brought us to Athkatla might know to whom Kiara was sold. His name is Prax. We were both sold south west of a circus last night.~ [ZAYAL4]
@3012 = ~At least this is some indication. You are welcome to join us and we shall immediately start looking for your friend.~
@3013 = ~My friend and I have been brought from a far land, east of Faerun, to be sold as slaves in Athkatla. All I know of this town is this jail in which you just found me. I beg of you, please help me.~ [ZAYAL5]
@3014 = ~I am sorry. I have more urgent matters to attend to. You are free and I can not help you further.~
@3015 = ~Very well. We need some more information, though. Do you know where she could be or perhaps somebody who might know her whereabouts?~
@3016 = ~Oh, I'm so pleased that you are going to help me. My name is Zaiya, and I am from Afyal. ~ [ZAYAL6]
@3017 = ~Well met Zaiya, my name is <CHARNAME>. I should tell you I have a goal to rescue a friend of mine, Imoen. She has been captured by the Cowled Wizards.~
@3018 = ~Well met Zaiya, my name is <CHARNAME>. I am hunting a very powerful evil mage named Irenicus. ~
@3019 = ~So, we have similar goals to rescue a friend but I wish to stress that my quest is really urgent, <CHARNAME>. I will die unless we find my friend within ten days.~ [ZAYAL7]
@3020 = ~I am doomed. I'd rather kill myself now rather than endure all this pain and suffering.~ [ZAYAL8]

@3202 = ~Thank you so much, <CHARNAME>, for helping me to find Kiara. I will follow her and wish you good luck finding your sister.~
@3203 = ~So, you won't help me find my friend. I should have guessed you'd let me die.~
@3204 = ~No, we shall keep looking for your friend. Come and join us.~
@3205 = ~I'm sorry Zaiya. You will have to find Kiara alone.~
@3206 = ~I have to follow Kiara. It was nice to travel with you <CHARNAME>.~
@3207 = ~You want us to leave <CHARNAME>?~
@3208 = ~No, please come back in the group.~
@3209 = ~Yes, you and Kiara should go.~

@3212 = ~Hello again, Zaiya. It seems the next ship is not due for a while; care to join us?~
@3213 = ~Hi Zaiya. I'm just checking to make sure both of you are alright.~
@3214 = ~Well, I suppose some time on the road couldn't hurt.~
@3215 = ~We're doing fine. They said a ship is due soon for Maztica.~
@3216 = ~We certainly had time to watch the grass grow since you last said "Wait right here, I won't be long." So, are we to travel with you once again?~
@3217 = ~Hello, Zaiya. Sorry for the delay. Please rejoin the group.~
@3218 = ~Hi Zaiya. I'm afraid I am expecting more delays.~
@3219 = ~Well, I suppose some time on the road won't hurt.~
@3220 = ~Not to worry, I have plenty of books to read and Kiara to talk to.~
@3221 = ~You are pathetic and weak. Be gone, fool.~
@3222 = ~The attitude of this party is not what I expected.~

@3402 = ~NO! How could this happen?...With Kiara dead, I, too, will die, and soon!~
@3403 = ~(Zaiya has an inquisitive look on her face.)~
@3404 = ~Are you all right, Zaiya?~

@3410 = ~Hum...Perhaps, a night in my arms could satisfy your last wish?~
@3411 = ~A man who laughs at the face of death, I like that. Come in my arms and let's both share our last night together!~
@3412 = ~You...You mean it's contagious...~
@3413 = ~Oh! Extremely. You might have it already just talking to me. So, why not just take a room..~
@3414 = ~A healer! I need a healer!  Helpppppp!~
@3415 = ~I can see fresh blood around her mouth and smell the stench of death. I would not like her as my mistress.~
@3416 = ~I have heard of your affliction. Where others have failed so lamentably, I would gladly offer to help you.~
@3417 = ~And how could you be of help when the attempts renowned mages and reputable clerics failed?~
@3418 = ~Your blight would go away in one bite...~
@3419 = ~A vampire! No, I'd rather die than be subjected to your wiles.~

@3424 = ~A mortal familiar with the likes of us! Are you from Calimshan?~
@3425 = ~No, I come from Afyal in the land of Zakhara.~
@3426 = ~The land of our distant cousins. But you do not look well, girl. I sense a strange aura around you, one of evil.~
@3427 = ~I...I have been cursed but have found no cure.~
@3428 = ~I was more talking about that dark companion at your side. Regarding your curse, unfortunately we can be of little help to you.~
@3429 = ~You should focus on the real threat. That is Irenicus, and not a renegade drow that has been of great help to us in the underdark.~
@3430 = ~We are at war with the drow. One can not be too cautious in present circumstances.~
@3431 = ~(Zaiya leans close to whisper in your ear.) The magic she speaks of is closely related to my specialty *wild magic*. But it is most peculiar; I do not sense such magic around us. That can only mean one thing: she is lying. We should be wary, as this may well be a trap.~
@3432 = ~Such treachery from Saemon will not go unpunished. After we deal with his master, of course.~
@3433 = ~Loyal companions are evidently hard to find. Treachery awaits us at every turn.~
@3434 = ~I hope nobody will dare say that it is my perfect place to be.~
@3435 = ~You guessed right mageling! I really wonder why the Cowled wizards have not sent you there earlier, an omission of some sort, surely.~
@3436 = ~This thief is quick in switching allegiances in order to save his own skin. We'd better be cautious with any offers he throws at us.~
@3437 = ~If I can give you a bit of advice stable boy, run fast, very fast, for <CHARNAME> is dead serious about it.~
@3438 = ~We are truly sorry to have disturbed your rest. Please be at peace. We shall take our leave right now.~
@3439 = ~What's wrong with you, Zaiya? We shall not leave, but put this ghost at rest once and for all!~
@3440 = ~Sorry Kiara, but you know how much I fear these ghosts. I am always afraid my own spirit will roam some place or another after my death.~
@3441 = ~Nonsense. Pull yourself together, girl.~
@3442 = ~This is awful. What foul beast would be cruel enough to bury people alive?~
@3443 = ~A man who cowardly uses children to shield himself from justice deserves to die!~
@3444 = ~That sounds horrible. Won't you help us kill them?~
@3445 = ~After several weeks spent here they look too weak to be of any use. With only the skin left on their bones, they'd also make a poor bait for these creatures.~
@3446 = ~Kiara! How can you make fun of these poor knights?~
@3447 = ~You want to be these creatures' meal?~
@3448 = ~This ambush is ominous and their mistress is probably watching our every move from afar.~
@3449 = ~I'm afraid you may be right, Zaiya. Bodhi seems to be ahead of us and may well lay a few more traps before we leave this island.~
@3450 = ~I wish we'd kept some of those wooden stakes Aran Linvail gave us.~
@3451 = ~Don't you have a heart, <CHARNAME>? How can you stay numb to the child's plea? Please, we must help him.~
@3452 = ~Hell no, young man. You shall wait until you have some beard under your chin before playing with any sword, right <CHARNAME>?~
@3453 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'll held you responsible if something happens to these kids. How could you give them both swords and ale?~
@3454 = ~A gruesome tale. I have no wish to share their fate, let alone to become a ghost. Perhaps we should run too <CHARNAME>.~
@3455 = ~Zaiya! We are not running anywhere. You are a mage, invoke a protection from fear upon yourself if you can't help it.~
@3456 = ~You are sending them to a gruesome death. What has become of you <CHARNAME>? Have you the heart of a drow?~
@3457 = ~I agree with Zaiya. You have become no different from the man I most despise.~
@3458 = ~Stop this babble and prepare to join me in death.~

//BZAIYA.D: ZAIYA'S BANTER FILE
@3700 = ~You surely signed my death too, <CHARNAME>. I'm sure it will leave a sour taste in your mouth long after Kiara and I have gone.~
@3701 = ~This trip reminded me of our long journey from Afyal and our time cramped and chained in the corsair's ship hold. I swear I'll never set foot on a ship again.~
@3702 = ~Here let me cast one spell to show you.~
@3703 = ~See? Completely mad...~
@3704 = ~You are on the surface, dark elf, and in no position to enforce your threats.~
@3705 = ~Where is your sense of humor, gnome?~
@3706 = ~Euh, yes. Thanks Korgan. I...I'll be careful... Kiara...Kiara!~
@3707 = ~Thank you, Jaheira. I'll try to follow your wise advice.~
@3708 = ~I sincerely hope you do.~
@3709 = ~Wherever Kiara goes, I follow. Don't ask me, ask her!~
@3710 = ~How arrogant of you, Keldorn, to presume what others are, what they would think or feel. I refuse to listen to this.~
@3711 = ~Why...I don't understand. Why did you not tell me?~
@3712 = ~Say no more! It only adds to my pain...~
@3713 = ~Why not sell the lands and the castle to the Roenalls and help the poor with the profits from the sale? Besides, it is likely the Roenalls would not seek to enforce your betrothal. You would gain handsomely.~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3714 = ~Kiara has become a friend and I would not take leave unless she asked me to. Like you, Miss Nalia, the weight of culture and traditions is very difficult to overcome. I wish you luck with the Roenalls.~
@3715 = ~I'm really sorry Minsc...It was an accident! I am so afraid of graveyards, and then...I had a hiccup and wild magic surged as if I had cast a spell! I didn't mean any harm to Boo, I swear to you.~
@3716 = ~These polymorphs don't last long and you should have your hamster back very soon...~
@3717 = ~You should be grateful for what life gave you Cernd: a son. My curse forbids such fortune and deprives me of ever bearing a child of my own. This makes me feel so angry at you.~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3718 = ~Well, thank you Cernd.~
@3719 = ~It looks like our stories are akin, Aerie. Whilst you lost the freedom to fly, I lost my freedom to live a normal life.~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3720 = ~I'm sure we will, Aerie...~
@3721 = ~You seem more afraid of magic than most and the curse running in your bloodline makes our lives similar.~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3722 = ~Let's hope they will.~
@3723 = ~This is outrageous, Zaiya. Many people on these lands depended on my family for generations. The Roenall's oppressive rule would certainly not favor them.~
@3724 = ~Miss Nalia, I was merely suggesting a way out of your dilemma with the Roenalls. I did not expect in the least your irritation.~
@3725 = ~Zaiya, I am truly exasperated by all these people who come with their own ideas of what I should do or how I should behave given my social status.~
@3726 = ~My Afyalan culture forbids such audacity. I was born and raised a servant and will always be a servant. I was merely giving you some advice for your personal consideration, Miss Nalia.~
@3727 = ~Then forgive my ill temper Zaiya. But tell me, have you no other ambitions than to remain a servant all your life? I find your statement hard to believe.~
@3728 = ~If I sometimes entertain personal ambitions such as gaining knowledge through reading, my own status and social position are sealed by tradition.~
@3729 = ~I am certainly unfamiliar with the traditions of your land, but in Amn and most of Faerun you will not find such restraints. You could achieve whatever status you wanted to hold.~
@3730 = ~My curse denies me any freedom and besides, I swore an oath to serve Kiara.~
@3731 = ~You are an odd pair to say the least. Would you not leave Kiara if you could?~
@3732 = ~Zaiya, this does not concern you. It is between <CHARNAME> and myself...~
@3733 = ~Of course it does. I entrust my life each day to your skilful hands and you dared not tell me this horrible truth. How despicable of you!~
@3734 = ~I am sorry Zaiya...I...~
@3735 = ~I pity you for your affliction but it seems the greater curse is to have to depend on this *harpy* for survival. She shows no love for those around her and I often wonder why she keeps you alive.~
@3736 = ~She wasn't like this in the past, at least when I met her. The recent events of our abduction by slavers have affected her deeply, although she confessed Amaralis was quite civil to her.~
@3737 = ~Regardless of the kindness she may have shown others in the past, I regard your mistress with great suspicion. She sought my death without due provocation nor obvious motive.~
@3738 = ~Her attitude towards you baffles me too. After a good bath, you'd make a handsome man which my mistress is often prone to seek attention from.~
@3739 = ~I see. Yet again my appearance is drawing far too much concern. But to straighten up the facts, the cabin was not a luxurious inn.~
@3740 = ~Hmm...Sorry to ask. I'm just curious. Were there no rivers nearby?~
@3741 = ~Ahem...Being caught naked and defenseless in the water would have been the least sensible thing to do.~
@3742 = ~No, unless the one catching you were some dryads or sorts.~
@3743 = ~Dryads? I'm afraid I had none of these chasing me lately.~
@3744 = ~Do you think the Cowled wizards will ever leave us in peace?~
@3745 = ~It is hard to tell but my guess is they won't.~
@3746 = ~I really wish I could help you, Zaiya, but my cleric skills are as useless for dealing with your curse as they are for fully healing the scars on my back.~
@3747 = ~I am sorry if I brought back painful memories when I was only seeking to share a mutual grief that perhaps could prove beneficial to us both. Sometimes I can't blame myself enough for studying those damned books.~
@3748 = ~I should have listened to my master and not gone on some foolish quest for greater knowledge. The retribution was severe but certainly deserved.~
@3749 = ~I do not think much of myself either without my wings, Zaiya. You should not blame yourself for what happened to you. How could you know?~
@3750 = ~My tutor forbid me so many times to read these books but my curiosity got the best of me. I was so naive and foolish and stupid...~
@3751 = ~I've proven foolish too when attempting to save those children from slavers. I've fallen prey to the latter's cruelty and achieved nothing but losing my freedom to fly. But what can we do, Zaiya? The past can not be undone. ~
@3752 = ~At least you can live in the comfort that your act was a noble one. You have done what was right and should feel proud.~
@3753 = ~I thank you for your kind words, Zaiya. I just wish your mistress would show the same compassion. Our journey with <CHARNAME> would be all the lighter.~
@3754 = ~She has her own worries, but proves unwilling to share her burden even with her closest friend. Besides, our arrival in Amn seems to have changed her mood drastically.~
@3755 = ~You certainly make an odd pair. I hope we find more time to chat in the future, Zaiya.~
@3756 = ~Why is that, Zaiya?~
@3757 = ~Because you are leaving your son behind when surely he needs a father to serve as a model, if not as a guide. If I was given that chance I would not forsake it for some damned life on the road.~
@3758 = ~Call it envy for something I long for and will never have...~
@3759 = ~I fail to understand... does this curse affect your womanhood too?~
@3760 = ~Of course not, but how could I ever be a mother knowing I could die the next day? Kiara may be here today to stabilize my curse but what if she died tomorrow? I could not fathom the idea of leaving my child an orphan.~
@3761 = ~But the child would have a father and he could take..~
@3762 = ~Yes, exactly!~
@3763 = ~Your anger and scorn are well deserved, but I can assure you I have not abandoned him. I shall return to him in good time to see him grow and act as any good father should.~
@3764 = ~I hope you do Cernd...I sincerely hope so.~
@3765 = ~If we were ever to find a cure for your affliction, I am sure you would make a fine mother. And I would be glad if you came to the grove and spend some time with us after this is all over.~
@3766 = ~Are you mocking me, Cernd?~
@3767 = ~No, I would not dare. I am sure that your compassion and kindness would only serve the boy well.~
@3768 = ~Of course, Keldorn. What troubles you?~
@3769 = ~Your mistress is hiding some dark truth from us. I can feel it. For your own sake, it would be wise to confess any secret she has shared with you.~
@3770 = ~I know nothing of the kind, Keldorn. Besides, I have never seen her doing anything that I was displeased with. I assure you, you are entertaining false ideas about my mistress.~
@3771 = ~Perhaps, though the feelings I have tell me she is not to be trusted. Then again, you obviously don't have many choices Zaiya. I hope for your sake we find soon a cure to your blight, for I shall not hesitate to kill your mistress if I am proven right.~
@3772 = ~You would give me no choice but to take my mistress’s side.~
@3773 = ~I had guessed as much, but tell me, would you not rather sacrifice yourself than let a greater evil come upon the world?~
@3774 = ~She shows her kindness every day, repelling death with blessed hands. You are annoying me, Keldorn. Let me be free of you and your ill conceived feelings.~
@3775 = ~You somehow know I am right. I shall let you ponder upon my words.~
@3776 = ~How dare you bring you such an abomination into my house? ~
@3777 = ~Am I really so ugly? Hey, I feel I owe you a demonstration of my wild magic skills.~
@3778 = ~No, no. You are going to ruin my beautiful house...~
@3779 = ~I insist. One slight problem... I can not guarantee the results. I'll try to get you squirrels, rabbits and some parrots but indeed I may as well destroy your house in the process.~
@3780 = ~This is insane. Please tell her to stop!~
@3781 = ~Viconia, I am quite a strong magician and surely prove my value to this party often enough.~
@3782 = ~Do not address me, trollop. <CHARNAME> rescued you merely out of his own sense of pity.~
@3783 = ~If it was my own choice. I would have let you rot in the filth in which we found you.~
@3784 = ~This is an insult to the gratitude you owe <CHARNAME>. Didn't <PRO_HESHE> come to your own rescue twice already? You are an evil bitch, Viconia.~
@3785 = ~You have some guts, rivvin. Do you know how we drow treat the likes of you?~
@3786 = ~Jan, you are ridiculous. Wild magic rarely occurs and I can control it most of the time. But for you, I promise to think of a turnip each time I cast a spell.~
@3787 = ~And how will that help?~
@3788 = ~Well, isn't turnip your favorite vegetable?~
@3789 = ~Yes...~
@3790 = ~Then what if you were transformed into a turnip? Wouldn't that be better than a toad?~
@3791 = ~Huh!~
@3792 = ~Jan Turnip...How does that sound?~
@3793 = ~Not so good, Zaiya.~
@3794 = ~Look at the optimistic side of it. We might even be able to sell you for a good price...on the first gnomish market. I bet they'll never believe we found such a big turnip.~
@3795 = ~This isn't funny, Zaiya...~
@3796 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. It never happened to me.~
@3797 = ~I hope for you girlie, it won't. What we did to 'tis magician, ye don't want to know.~
@3798 = ~What did you do to him?~
@3799 = ~We hacked the bloody wizard into pieces and fed it to the crows. Ye are warned, girlie. Ye might turn me into a squirrel, but don't mess with the gold.~
@3800 = ~I love these books. They...they are all I have..~
@3801 = ~You should take time to admire mother nature and breathe some fresh air, it would certainly improve your health.~
@3802 = ~I might find a remedy to my curse in one of these books one day.~
@3803 = ~I feel sorry for you, girl, and I sincerely hope you will find a way out of this curse.~
@3804 = ~These dusty old tomes should not be your only focus. Take time to enjoy the nature's beauty and I am sure you will find comfort of a sort.~
@3805 = ~The thought is most kind and appreciated though you shouldn't feel troubled. I have Kiara.~
@3806 = ~I find it strange that she helps you. After all isn't she tempted by the evil side?~
@3807 = ~She shows far more kindness than most people think she would. She has a dark secret she won't reveal, even to a trusted servant such as me. I suspect her evilness derives from it as else, she is a likeable person.~
@3808 = ~You seem quite fond of her.~
@3809 = ~She is my caretaker and I am her servant but we have become friend and confidant. We were both lost children when we met, with no friends and no real family. Kiara naturally became like an elder sister to me and we've helped each other mutually.~
@3810 = ~I had a sister too, and I wished I could have helped her. Her death fills my heart with guilt..~
@3811 = ~I am truly sorry, Anomen. I wish I hadn't stirred such dreadful and painful memories. I overheard the accounts of this tragedy, but it seems you are not to blame for your family's fate.~
@3812 = ~Your father's hatred for this rival merchant has blinded him and brought his own downfall.~
@3813 = ~What makes you think my father is wrong, Zaiya, and that this merchant is blameless?~
@3814 = ~My experience with Kiara. She herself blames the head of the monastic order for the death of her first love and bears a hatred that blinds her beyond reason.~
@3815 = ~I often have conversations with her over this, but she usually loses her temper over my attempts to dissuade her from revenge.~
@3816 = ~From what I have seen, your father does seem to bear the same stigmas. You would follow the same path if you let the desire of revenge guide your actions. Take some time to think over it.~
@3817 = ~I will. My thanks, Zaiya.~
@3818 = ~I have a wild mage in my party, who can summon squirrels, rabbits and even parrots if you like.~
@3819 = ~I would have a word with you Zaiya...In private.~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3820 = ~<CHARNAME>, have you lost your wits? Can't you see that Zaiya's magic is a danger to us all?~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3821 = ~<CHARNAME>, I fear Zaiya might transform one of us into a squirrel, a rabbit, or even worse a toad.~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3822 = ~<CHARNAME>, ye know our magician girlie could ruin our party with it bloody' wild surges. I've had a bad experience with their kind, 'twas at a time I traveled with Polgo, a wild mage too. Damn fool. We lost all our gold on his first spell.~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3823 = ~Tell me Zaiya, why do you spend so much time the nose in your books?~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3824 = ~It troubles me to see such a lovely lady in dire needs and myself unable to help her despite my skills in the healing arts.~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3825 = ~Don't worry, Zaiya. If that dwarf tries to get near you, he'll have to kill me first.~
@3826 = ~(Zaiya has been mostly quiet during the several months of travel but did prove a powerful mage. She seems to know what you are about to ask and already looks towards Kiara.)~
@3827 = ~Zaiya, this isn't your fight. You are young, beautiful, and have a life ahead of you.~
@3828 = ~Zaiya, you don't have to go if you don't want to. You have a life ahead of you.~
@3829 = ~Zaiya, I know that this isn't your fight, but you won't back out on me now, will you?~
@3830 = ~Zaiya, you mean woman, what have you done to Boo! Why does he look and talk like a chicken?~ [MxZaiyaA]
@3831 = ~Minsc, why do you complain? This hamster of yours was useless. Now at least we can have fresh eggs every morning.~
@3832 = ~Eggs? Nay. 'Tis opened up me appetite. I say let's fry the birdie now...~
@3833 = ~Tell me Minsc, am I mistaken, or do I see a giant space chicken?~
@3834 = ~Minsc will kick your evil butts, all of you. I want Boo back!!!~
@3835 = ~His clucking is driving me maaaaad...~

@3851 = ~Certainly, Zaiya. What is it that you wish to know?~ //cernd
@3852 = ~Why do you not recoil in horror around me? There are plenty who outright hate wild mages, yet you do not. If anything, you are quite accepting of my presence.~//zai
@3853 = ~I find that very strange, considering how many other people look at me with fear.~ //zai
@3854 = ~Why should I feel horror? It is true that your passage seems to presage chaos, but no more so than that of our Bhaalspawn companion. If one wishes to travel the ways of Balance, then one must accept the extremes as well as the middle-ground.~ //Cernd

@3858 = ~(Cernd places a hand on the dandelions, encompassing Zaiya's small hand with his larger one. The yellow sprouts then turn into white puff-balls.)~ //Cernd
@3859 = ~And yet for the next generation, the seeds of the present must be blown away by the chaos of the storm... (Cernd lowers his head, and takes a deep breath, blowing half of the seeds away. He then beckons for Zaiya to do the rest.)~ //Cernd
@3860 = ~Many people forget that chaos is nature's way of redressing an imbalance. Whether it is the fire that guts an overcrowded forest or a fierce storm that flattens a field, chaos may have a salubrious effect.~ 
//Cernd
@3861 = ~That may be, but even you have to admit that when my magic backfires and someone becomes a piece of poultry, that doesn't exactly aid the balance, now does it?~ //Zai
@3862 = ~No, but neither does it take away from it.~ //Cernd
@3863 = ~(Zaiya suddenly realizes Cernd's hand is on hers, and she rapidly pulls it away.)~ //Zai
//Second Scene for Cernd-Zaiya
@3864 = ~I believe I owe you an apology, Cernd.~ [MxZaiyaA] //Zai
@3865 = ~Oh, hello Zaiya. I'm sorry; you caught me with my head in the clouds. Maybe you would care to clarify your thoughts, but what do you need to apologize for?~ //Cernd
@3866 = ~I fear I spoke out of turn the last time we talked. It was not my intent to try and cast doubt on the course your life chose, for I do not know the intricacies of the druidic hierarchy. It seems to me that you do not serve nature, but rather the needs of those who presume to speak for nature.~ //Zai
@3867 = ~Indeed, and I will readily agree that your insight has been like the rain that falls in the desert, bringing life to the parched earth.~ 
//cernd
@3868 = ~Though the terrain may lie barren, the seeds of life lie underneath, ready to sprout to life with proper nourishment. However, your motives are still obscured like the gathered rain clouds overhead..~ //cernd
@3869 = ~Cernd, for one who serves nature, it seems you...what is that phrase? Ah yes, you don't see the forest for the trees. You left your son behind. You left your wife, Cernd, because of duty, which is a concept of humanity, not of nature. I can think of no stronger natural bond than that of family.~ //Zai
@3870 = ~Need I point out that all manners of creatures do display loyalty to a hierarchy? What of wolves in a pack, or bees in a hive?~
@3871 = ~I must have touched some emotion, for your analogies aren't clearly thought out...for animals, unlike humans, are loyal from instinct, and their bond is among the most primal, if strongest sort...the bond to one's family, to one's kind...~

//Cernd-Zaiya third scene
@3872 = ~Cernd...~ [MxZaiyaA] //zai
@3873 = ~What is it now, Zaiya? Come you now to undermine one of my fundamental beliefs and cut me from the inside much as a wood bore fells the mightiest oak?~ //cernd
@3874 = ~No Cernd, I come to do no such thing. I thought merely to apologize for my presumption, but I see that you are still angry at my words. Pardon, I will leave you be. I should have said nothing at all.~ //zai
@3875 = ~Then why did you concern yourself with my affairs at all, Zaiya?~ //cernd
@3876 = ~I...I don’t know Cernd.~ //zai
//cernd-zaiya fourth scene
@3877 = ~To whom do you answer, Cernd?~ [MxZaiyaA] //zai
@3878 = ~Pardon Zaiya? I fear I may have missed your question.~ //cernd
@3879 = ~To whom do you answer, Cernd, for your actions?~ //zai
@3880 = ~What do you mean, to whom do I answer? If you are asking about my responsibilities, and how I accomplish them, then I guess I ultimately answer to the Grand Druid, and beyond that, Nature herself.~ //cernd
@3882 = ~(Zaiya nods.) Just as I answer to Kiara for my own course of action. Very well. This is the question that bothers me. If you ultimately serve the needs of nature, then by following the dictates of this 'Grand Druid' and whomever else, aren't you just putting a human conceit on the face of an unknowable force?~ //zai
@3883 = ~It may be that we druids are deluding ourselves in our concept of nature, though I doubt it. Balance must be maintained, but people are not necessarily creatures of Balance, so we must enforce it ourselves, as druids. However, I must admit that I am curious as for the reason behind this line of questioning.~ //cernd
@3884 = ~Simple. What does being one with nature have to do with serving the aims of another? Especially when it places yourself out of balance…~//zai
//Cernd-Zaiya no 5
@3885 = ~Zaiya, we must talk…~ [MxZaiyaA] //Cernd
@3886 = ~(Zaiya's voice is quiet, subdued.) Yes, Cernd, what is it? Come to finally vent the rage that was surely building in your breast? Come to chastise me for the holding of your hand? Very well, have at it.~ //Zaiya
@3887 = ~I will not lie, Zaiya, the words you spoke did cause an upheaval within my mind and heart. After all, who likes to have the firmament they build their beliefs upon thrown asunder? But within all of that, I realized something…~ //cernd
@3888 = ~Yes, Cernd, what is it?~ //zai
@3889 = ~Your words found fertile ground. Mind you, I still think that there are responsibilities to which I must attend, but in the matter of my son, you are entirely correct.~ //cend
@3890 = ~Just as a pack of wolves raises the next generation, so too should I raise my son,…but that is not what I came to discuss.~//Cernd
@3891 = ~(A smile slowly spreads across Zaiya's face) And what is it that you wish to talk about? I must admit that our conversations have proven an interesting…undertaking…~ //zai
@3892 = ~(Cernd grasps her hand, for a moment pausing to admire the soft, white delicacy of it against his own nut-brown palm.) Just as your words have me made re-evaluate certain…responsibilities,…they have also brought me further insight.~ //cernd
@3893 = ~Do I have to drag this out of you, Cernd?~ //zai
@3894 = ~I have been contemplating your illness. I know that you and Kiara searched throughout the lands of the east for a cure, but have you scoured the lands of the west?~ //cernd
@3895 = ~More specifically, there may be something in druidic lore that could cure your affliction.~ //cernd
@3896 = ~(Not without a touch of reluctance, Zaiya pulls her hand from Cernd's.) I..…Cernd...I...I am impressed that you would do such for me…but..~//zai
@3897 = ~(Zaiya hangs her head, a gleam of quiet desperation shining in her tear-filled eyes.) I have had too many instances of false hope. I am not...I won’t go.. dash..…Oh Cernd, just go away, would you?~

@5225 = ~What kind of act?~
@5226 = ~No, I shall not do this!~
@5227 = ~**VERY WELL, BUT FIRST I WANT YOU TO GET RID OF AMARALIS FOR ME. WE HAD A DEAL HE RENEGED UPON. SUCH TREACHERY DESERVES DEATH. YOU WILL FIND HIM IN SMALL TEETH PASS. YOU HAVE TEN DAYS. IF YOU SUCCEED, I SHALL GIVE YOU A LAST TASK.**~

//TOB Ends
@9100 = ~After the Bhaalspawn saga events were behind them, Kiara and <CHARNAME> proved a match made in heavens. For a while, they settled in Athkatla and attempted to live a simple but cushy life. <CHARNAME> was soon offered a chair on the council of six after the sudden death of the Meisarch but declined upon Kiara's insistence. She could not fathom the idea of becoming a mere housewife and dragged <CHARNAME> on the road once again, tempting him with a visit to her homeland of Kara Tur.
The legend purports that during a halt in Afyal the Demon lord visited Kiara once more only to disavow his word and take Kiara to the abyss. <CHARNAME> followed the Demon lord with the help of Cyric, the reigning God Of Murder, who had long waited for an opportunity to take revenge on the Demon Lord for his treachery. After the two of them united in the shadowy depths of the demon's plane, the legend goes on to say that the ensuing slaughter has left the abyss scarred for a thousand years. Kiara and <CHARNAME> single handed fought and killed countless demons including a fierce Demon prince, before escaping unscathed through Mount Doom. A persistent rumor speaks of Ardic promising Kiara and <CHARNAME> would rule the abyss after the end of their mortal existence. However, neither Kiara nor <CHARNAME> ever confirmed those accounts, when asked they simply stare at each other and start laughing.
After mount doom, they proceeded to Kara Tur and Kiara led <CHARNAME> to her old monastery, once again a peaceful and restful place, free of Balthazar's fist rule. A place where Kiara was soon to give birth to a male heir that would proudly bear the name and heritage of his father, growing over the years into a fierce and renowned monk. Kiara, however, died in giving birth despite the monk's efforts to heal her. A long procession of mourners, from as far as Afyal, came to the monastery to pay tribute to the legend of Kiara, the monk who defeated the abyss. 
<CHARNAME> never quite recovered but found much pride in educating his son. Their trip back to Athkatla proved for the young monk a remarkable adventure as they fought bandits, gibberlings and other lesser foes, which <CHARNAME> could have easily chased away by the mere spelling of his name. Instead, he sat quietly, watching his son dispatching the poor creatures as easily as he would himself, a pleasing smile on his face and a tear in his eye as memories of his own past surfaced, remembering the young adventurer he once was himself, remembering how it all started, somewhere near Candlekeep, on the sword coast~
@9101 = ~<CHARNAME>'s ascendance to Godhood affected Kiara deeply. She tried to find comfort in meditation when she overtook the monastic order of Amkethran but the wound in her heart would clearly never heal. Instead, she was slowly overcome by an insidious madness partly due to the birth of a stillborn son. One of her closest and trusted friend, Zaiya, relates she wanted to give her one love, the god of murder, a gift of blood in his honor, one to be forever remembered. 
A year later and for no reason, she prompted a war with Amn that would surpass and outlive the bloody history of the Bhaalspawn saga. Amn, facing an army of a thousand monks and mercenaries led by her fearsome and mad leader Kiara, gathered the largest alliance Faerun could possibly fathom in an attempt to thwart the threat. 
Red They wizards, Paladins from the order of the Radiant heart, Harpers, Thieves, Cowled wizards and Elves at the head of which queen Ellesime herself, all set aside their grievances and joined the elite troops of Amn to face Kiara's army. The ensuing battle was one of epic proportion. Kiara and her army rushed into battle, spreading death like a wild fire, destroying a quarter of Amn’s forces on their first onslaught. Oblivious to magic and wielding death at the palm of their hands, Kiara's army of monks seemed almost invincible. Many in the ranks of Amn started to lose faith when according to numerous witnesses that day, something extraordinary happened. The legend tells Amn’s gruesome fate was salvaged by the premature death in battle of Kiara at the hand of an unknown foe. Some murmur the black hooded figure that suddenly appeared on the battlefield and stroked the death blow was one of the gods angered by Kiara's madness or perhaps a greater Demon, yet a persistent rumor speaks of the Lord of Murder himself. 
Ever since, her name has been one of infamy that remains unspoken in history books, even prompting Volo to erase all accounts of Kiara from his own book on the great Bhaalspawn. But town folk Legends often supersede written scriptures, and many citizens of Faerun still speak of the Lord of Murder's vengeful fist and how Ao, the overfather himself, was forced to intervene, ordering The Lord of Murder to sever his murderous arm. Some go on to say that the Lord of Murder took Kiara at his right side for her body was never found on the battlefield, other place her in the abyss where her black soul suffers eternal torture.~

Instead, she was slowly overcome by an insidious madness partly due to the birth of a stillborn son. One of her closest and trusted friend, Zaiya, relates she wanted to give her one love, the god of murder, a gift of blood in his honor, one to be forever remembered. 
A year later and for no reason, she prompted a war with Amn that would surpass and outlive the bloody history of the Bhaalspawn saga. Amn, facing an army of a thousand monks and mercenaries led by her fearsome and mad leader Kiara, gathered the largest alliance Faerun could possibly fathom in an attempt to thwart the threat. 
Red Thay wizards, Paladins from the order of the Radiant heart, Harpers, Thieves, Cowled wizards and Elves at the head of which queen Ellesime herself, all set aside their grievances and joined the elite troops of Amn to face Kiara's army. The ensuing battle was one of epic proportion. Kiara and her army rushed into battle, spreading death like a wild fire, destroying a quarter of Amn’s forces on their first onslaught. Oblivious to magic and wielding death at the palm of their hands, Kiara's army of monks seemed almost invincible. Many in the ranks of Amn started to lose faith when according to numerous witnesses that day, something extraordinary happened. The legend tells Amn’s gruesome fate was salvaged by the premature death in battle of Kiara at the hand of an unknown foe. Some murmur the black hooded figure that suddenly appeared on the battlefield and stroked the death blow was one of the gods angered by Kiara's madness or perhaps a greater Demon, yet a persistent rumor speaks of the Lord of Murder himself. 
Ever since, her name has been one of infamy that remains unspoken in history books, even prompting Volo to erase all accounts of Kiara from his own book on the great Bhaalspawn. But town folk Legends often supersede written scriptures, and many citizens of Faerun still speak of the Lord of Murder's vengeful fist and how Ao, the overfather himself, was forced to intervene, ordering The Lord of Murder to sever his murderous arm. Some go on to say that the Lord of Murder took Kiara at his right side for her body was never found on the battlefield, other place her in the abyss where her black soul suffers eternal torture.~

@9103 = ~After the Bhaalspawn saga ended, Zaiya took the first ship sailing from Amn to Afyal. Half across the sea, a ship started to follow them at a distance and it became clear to all onboard it had to be pirates or slavers. Zaiya showing courage and determination whisked everyone to safety in the ship's hold, whilst she would be  standing firmly on the deck awaiting the pirate's boarding. Pirates who survived Zaiya's rage to tell the tale, speak of their amazement to see a frail woman at the helm of the ship, the main deck deserted. Almost certain the ship as much as the women was theirs, they shouted scornful insults at Zaiya but the women stood her ground. Zaiya shouted back not to attempt boarding lest they all wanted to die, which prompted much laughter in the pirate's flock whilst some already were rushing on the deck. A few minutes later, it was all over. The pirates were overrun by fear and jumped starboard, clinging onto the remaining planks of wood of their defunct ship. 
On arrival in Afyal, the news of Zaiya's exploits aboard the ship spread like wildfire and rumors soon came to all influential nobles of the city. They invited Zaiya at their table to hear of her tales of the great Bhaalspawn. Weary of her fame, month later Zaiya bought the house of her former master and lived a quiet life. On the news of Kiara's death, she rushed to Kyoro and tried to comfort <CHARNAME> as much as she could. She stayed for some time and took care of Kiara's offspring but it became obvious <CHARNAME> had grown old and his desire to leave for Amn prompted Zaiya to make the return journey to her own homeland where she once again settled in her own habits and house.~
