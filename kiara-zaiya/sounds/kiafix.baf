After the tragic death of her parents, she was rescued by a local monastery and although extremely rare for a girl, raised as a monk. She spent most of her youth there and learnt some basic fighting skills, herbal preparations and meditation. For an obscure reason, although from the tear in her eye you guess a tragic event, she was expelled from the monastery at an early age. She traveled to the west and met some merchants along the road which she escorted first to Tu Lung before embarking aboard a ship to the city of Medina al Afyal. This is an adventure she highly speaks of with an enthusiastic tone in her voice. On arrival at Afyal, she mentions she met Zaiya before being abducted by corsairs and sold as slaves in Athkatla. You see her face darken under her monk's hood; you know she will say no more.~
